Sorry, no goodies yet. However, MagicMenu from Martin Korndoerfer is
cool for MUI as well as screennotify.library from Stefan Becker. You
might also want to look for NewEdit or something similar for clipboard
support in string gadgets.

ClickForColors:
--------------

MUI  uses  both externally and internally the colors and graphics of the
well-known  shareware  product MagicWB.  If you should not have set your
workbench  to the MagicWB color standard, you are able to catch up on it
by  clicking  on  the  icon 'ClickForColors'.  You will be rewarded by a
much more colorful and pleasing look of MUI and its icons.

Before  doing  that  you should set your screenmode to 8 colors and save
the  setting.   Then  start the aforementioned icon.  You will instantly
notice the new colors.  To avoid that this palette is lost after a reset
you  must  also  save  this  setting by starting the palette preferences
program and leaving it with clicking on the "Save" button.
