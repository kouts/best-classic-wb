<h3>ITD * Image To Disk</h3>
Tool to write disk images back to a floppy like device.
<h4>Installation</h4>
ITD is contained only in the <tt>DEV</tt> archive, not in the <TT>USR</tt>
archive.<br>Copy it to C: or a similar place.
<h4>Options</h4>

<tt>File/A,Device,Format/S,BS=BlockSize/N,ASync/S,ForceOverwriteLargeDevice/S</tt>
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
<tt>File/A</tt>
</td><td>
name of the file which contains the disk image to write to the device
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
<tt>Device</tt>
</td><td>
the device to which ITD will write the image
<br>default "DF0:"
<br>example "RAD:"
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top nowrap>
<tt>Format/S</tt>
</td><td>
if enabled the disk will also be formatted while written, for most devices this
makes no difference
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
<tt>BlockSize/N</tt>
</td><td>
the amount of data read and written during each cycle, the default is the size
of a track (BlocksPerTrack*SizeBlock)<br>
if operating on larger devices it may improve the performance to use a larger block
size but beware that some devices don't work correctly with block sizes larger
then 130,560 ($1fe00) or even 65,024 ($fe00)
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
<tt>ASync/S</tt>
</td><td>
if enabled ITD will write asynchron to the destination device<br>
don't use if source file and destination device are located on the same
physical device, because it will slow down the operation<br>
if either of source file and destination device supports DMA it will
significant improve the performance of the copy operation
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
<tt>ForceOverwriteLargeDevice/S</tt>
</td><td>
normally ITD will not read from files or write to devices larger
than 2,000,000 bytes. Using this switch it will operate on files and devices
with any size.
</td></tr>

<h4>Return code</h4>
Set to 0 on success otherwise 20.
<h4>Background</h4>
ITD can write to any trackdisk like device. To avoid problems (e.g. corrupting
your harddrive) it does not write to devices larger than 2,000,000 bytes except
option ForceOverwriteLargeDevice/S is used. If the write operation will go outside
the 4 GiB bounds it will use TrackDisk64 commands.<br>
There will be NO verify performed.<br>
If the image is smaller than the device you will get a warning message. ITD
will not change the remaining tracks in this case but will round up the size to
a full block and clear the trailing space. If the image is larger you will also
get a message and ITD will write as much data as fits on the device.
