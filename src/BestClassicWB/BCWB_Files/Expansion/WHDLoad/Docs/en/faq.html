Ok, I got the installer and there are problems with either the installation or
the start. I am sure I have done everything correctly so far. What now?

Such misbehavior may be due to a number of reasons:
<ul>
<li>missing/wrong Tooltypes<br> Some fixes won't run properly (or at all) if
you do not set the correct tooltypes for your system. Read the documentation
to find out which tooltypes are supported. Example Tooltypes which may help
are NoCache, NoVBRMove, NoAutoVec, PAL/NTSC, NoMMU.
<li>readme file that comes with the install package<br>This often explains
some specific problems, keys or tooltypes that have to be set.
<li>wrong WHDLoad version<br> Most Installs need the latest version of WHDLoad
and will not run with a older one. The golden rule is to always have the
latest version installed.
<li>your machine is incompatible<br> Especially a 68040/060 CPU or some
turboboards/other hardware may cause problems. Try to turn off all extra
hardware and try to start the install again.
<li>unsupported version<br> Many commercial games have been sold in more than
one version (full price release/budget re-release/coverdisk release, PAL/NTSC
version,...). Of course an install can only work if it has been written
especially for a special version of a game. If you have a different version of
the same game, it won't work. In that case, the only way to use the install is
to contact the author of the install and ask him to support your version. In
most cases the author will help you and patch your version of the game, too,
within a few days.
<li>old version of the install<br> As soon as a bug is discovered and removed,
the new version of the fix is made available at the WHDLoad website. Always
get the latest version of the install. Please note that the latest version is
not always the one in Aminet. Some patches are not released on Aminet at all,
and many are released with a few weeks delay!
<li>you discovered a bug<br> Although all fixes are tested before release, a
bug might have escaped unnoticed. If you think you have discovered a bug,
write a detailed report of your problem to the author of the patch. For this,
use the bug report form. Try to report your problem as accurately as possible.
If we aren't informed about bugs we can't correct them. Note: The ONLY correct
place for problems/bug reports is the bug report form and not
comp.sys.amiga.games or any forum because not every developer reads them.

Question:

I have a game but I don't find an installer for it.
</b></td></tr><tr><td valign=top><i>
Answer:
</i></td><td>
Make a list of your wishes. You may also include games which are already
installable on HD on their own (copyable files and/or an installer supplied
with the game itself) which have problems (even with simple degrading problems
or no quit).
Keep in mind that a person is only able to patch about 25 games per year.
Indicate with a priority which are your favourites (eg ! and +) and dislikes
(-), and check yourself which games already have HD installs.

Question:
</i></td><td><b>
Is it possible to use WHDLoad to install a demo/game which uses the
operating system ?
</b></td></tr><tr><td valign=top><i>
Answer:
</i></td><td>
In general it is not possible for a demo/game running inside WHDLoad to access
OS stuff outside, from where WHDLoad has been started. You as the writer of the
required Slave program have to patch all accesses to the OS. Either you disable
such accesses or you have to emulate them appropriately. For the emulation the
so-called KickEmu packages exist. They are available for different Kickstart versions
(eg. 'Sources/whdload/kick13.s'). By using an image of a real kickstart, they
create a full OS-environment inside the WHDLoad memory. There is a extra ReadMe
file concerning: 'Sources/whdload/kick.readme'.

Question:
</i></td><td><b>
If WHDLoad uses the MMU (option <a href="opt.html#NoMMU">NoMMU/S</a> is not
set and on a 68030 option <a href="opt.html#MMU">MMU/S</a> is set there are
short errors in the graphics and/or in the music (e.g. Beast2). A bug ?
</b></td></tr><tr><td valign=top><i>
Answer:
</i></td><td>
This occurs during loading. The reason is that WHDLoad must switch off the
interrupts during loading for a short period if the MMU is used. This behavior
cannot be changed.

Question:
</i></td><td><b>
When I try to use the NTSC tooltype WHDLoad shows an Guru.
</b></td></tr><tr><td valign=top><i>
Answer:
</i></td><td>
There is an bug in MCP 1.30 in the ScreenManager which causes WHDLoad
OpenScreenTags call to crash. Disable the ScreenManager in MCP to aid.

Question:
</i></td><td><b>
When run games they are running quicker than normal (Music sounds strange) and
the bottom of the display is missing. I have tried both PAL &amp; NTSC tooltypes but nothing helps.

If you are using the Voodoo monitor driver, turn off the "FakeNativeModes" in the tooltypes
of the monitor drive.
