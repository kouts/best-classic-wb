<h3>Network access Overview</h3>

WHDLoad is able to use a network access to check if there exists a newer
version of WHDLoad and the Slave file specified. All network activity is done
using the HTTP-protocol. The global option <a href="opt.html#Proxy">Proxy/S</a>
can be used to route all network traffic through a proxy server. To access a
proxy which requires authentication a user/password can specified using the <a
href="opt.html#Proxy">Proxy/S</a> option. WHDLoad only supports the basic
authentication type.

<br>If no network access by WHDLoad is wished, all network activity can be
disabled using the <a href="opt.html#NoNetwork">NoNetwork/S</a> global option.

<h3>WHDLoad and Slave update check</h3>

Using an request to the WHDLoad website it will be checked if a newer version
of WHDLoad or the installed program (Slave) has been already released.

<br>The check is only performed if the <a href="opt.html#SplashDelay">splash
window</a> is opened because the result information is displayed there.

<p>For the WHDLoad update check the version number from the used WHDLoad will
be sent. If a newer WHDLoad release exists the splash window will show the
version number and the release date of the most actual WHDLoad release.
Additional an 'Update WHDLoad' button is added to the splash window. If you
have installed the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openurllib/">openurl.library</a> pressing
the button will open your configured web browser pointing to the WHDLoad home
page. If no openurl.library is available a requester is shown with the URL of
the WHDLoad home page. If the option <a href="opt.html#Expert">Expert/S</a> is
set the update check will also inform about new beta releases of WHDLoad.

<p>To perform the Slave update check WHDLoad calculates the SHA-256 digest of
the Slave file which is sent to the WHDLoad web site. There is a database of
all released Slave files. If a newer Install/Slave exists the splash window
will show the release date of the most actual Install release. Additional an
'Update Slave' button is added to the splash window. If you have installed the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openurllib/">openurl.library</a>
pressing the button will open your configured web browser pointing to the
WHDLoad page of that install. If no openurl.library is available a requester is
shown with the URL of the WHDLoad install page.

<p>If a newer WHDLoad or Slave exists an extra 'Start' button is added to the
splash window and the window will not close automatically to place the emphasis
on the update possibility. The window can be closed as usual using the mouse,
Space, Return or Esc.

<p>If <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openurllib/">openurl.library</a>
is used and the 'Update' button is pressed WHDLoad will try to reenable the
IP-stack by performing the <a
href="opt.html#ExecuteCleanup">ExecuteCleanup/K</a> command, because usually
the IP-stack got disabled previously by the <a
href="opt.html#ExecuteStartup">ExecuteStartup/K</a> command. This may fail if
there is not enough free memory as the start of the web browser because <a
href="opt.html#Preload">Preload/S</a> has occupied most of the memory. So in
low memory situation the 'Update' button may not be usable.
