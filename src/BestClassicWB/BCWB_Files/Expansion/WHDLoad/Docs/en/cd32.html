<h3>WHDLoadCD32</h3>

WHDLoadCD32 is a special WHDLoad version to be used on the CD&sup3;&sup2;. It
has been optimized for this hardware and will therefore only run on a plain not
expanded CD&sup3;&sup2;. It will not run on SX-32 or any other machine.

<p>These are the differences to the normal WHDLoad:
<ul>

<li>it does not require nor use a WHDLoad keyfile, therefore CDs with
WHDLoadCD32 on it can be distributed freely

<li>only the 68020 CPU is supported, which means also no MMU support

<li>fast memory is not supported

<li>there is absolut no writing support, neither savegames, highscores nor
coredumps (a CD is usually read-only)

<li>many options have been removed which are not useful on a CD&sup3;&sup2; to
make the executable smaller and save memory, check <a href="opt.html">Usage and
Options</a> to see which options are omitted

<li>the following resload functions are not implemented and using them will
terminate WHDLoad with a return value TDREASON_ILLEGALARGS:

<ul>
<li><a href="../autodoc.html#resload_DiskLoadDev">resload_DiskLoadDev</a>
<li><a href="../autodoc.html#resload_ProtectRead">resload_ProtectRead</a>
<li><a href="../autodoc.html#resload_ProtectReadWrite">resload_ProtectReadWrite</a>
<li><a href="../autodoc.html#resload_ProtectWrite">resload_ProtectWrite</a>
<li><a href="../autodoc.html#resload_ProtectRemove">resload_ProtectRemove</a>
<li><a href="../autodoc.html#resload_ProtectSMC">resload_ProtectSMC</a>
<li><a href="../autodoc.html#resload_Log">resload_Log</a>
</ul>

<li>the following resload functions are dummies, they will do nothing but return
always success:

<ul>
<li><a href="../autodoc.html#resload_SaveFile">resload_SaveFile</a>
<li><a href="../autodoc.html#resload_SaveFileOffset">resload_SaveFileOffset</a>
<li><a href="../autodoc.html#resload_DeleteFile">resload_DeleteFile</a>
</ul>

<li>there is no <a href="freezer.html">freezer/monitor</a> support built in

<li>there is no internal check for sufficient stackspace as in the normal
WHDLoad, to my tests the default of 4096 bytes should enough for WHDLoadCD32

</ul>

<h3>Hints for using WHDLoad on a CD&sup3;&sup2;</h3>

The main problem on the CD&sup3;&sup2; is the limited main memory. There are
only 2 MiB of chip memory. Therefore the aim must be to get as much free memory
as possible for WHDLoad and especially for the <a href="opt.html#Preload">Preload/S</a> operation. Make sure that
no other programs are running while starting an installed program using
WHDLoadCD32.

<ul>

<li>If install gives the choice between diskimages and files use files. Because
many smaller files can be better cached than less big files.

<li>If an install provides the ability to compress files using ProPack/FImp use
it and compress all files (RNC1 gives best compression ratio). Compressed files
need less memory for Preload and cause nearly no delay in loading speed.

<li>Use AllocMemReverse before running WHDLoadCD32 (or an adequate
replacement). AllocMemReverse is a small program included in the dev-package of
WHDLoad. It patches the exec function AllocMem to always use the memory
attribute MEM_REVERSE for the allocations. That will result in memory getting
allocated from the top of the free memory to the bottom and not from bottom to
top as normal. This will hold the lower memory regions free. The background
is, that WHDLoad needs memory starting at address 0, the start of chipmem. All
memory which is used in this lower region needs to be swapped out. To save this
swapped memory additional memory is required. The more memory is used in the
low memory regions the less is available for the installed program and for
preloading data files.

<li>Always use the <a href="opt.html#Data">Data</a> option. Preload does not
know which files will be loaded by the installed program, therefore it loads all
files it finds. To avoid that unnecessary files are loaded create a directory
which only contains the required files. Delete all obsolete stuff like #?.info,
#?.Slave, ReadMe, Manual, .... Then call WHDLoad with Slave and Data directory
as argument, e.g. <tt>WHDLoadCD32 :Slaves/XYZ.Slave Data=:Data/XYZ Preload</tt>.
There is no need to change the current directory to anywhere.

<li>Don't use XPK compressed data files. XPK decompression needs much memory
because XPK libraries must be in memory, decompression itself needs memory and
decompression will cause memory fragmentation.
