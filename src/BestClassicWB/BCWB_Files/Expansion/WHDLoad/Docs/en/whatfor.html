<h3>What WHDLoad is for</h3>
WHDLoad is designed for easy installation of programs to a harddisk (demos, games, ...)
which kill the operating system. To install a program, a so called "Slave" must
be written. The Slave is the interface between the program and WHDLoad, and
co-ordinates the reading and writing of files.
<p>Because of the simple interface and the example sources, it will be
easy for anybody with knowledge about the Amiga and programming to install
nearly any program on harddisk.
