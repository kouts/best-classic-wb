<h3>DIC * Disk Image Creator</h3>
<p>DIC is a tool to create an file image of a floppy disk. DIC reads the
contents of the floppy disk via the appropriate device (e.g.
"trackdisk.device" for DF0:) and writes the data to a plain file in the
actual directory. The name of disk image file created will be "Disk.1",
where "1" is the number of the disk read. The disk number is increased
after each disk read. Using the <tt>Name</tt> option a different name for
the image to create can be specified.</p>
<p>DIC can also read other devices like RAD:, PC0: or DS0: and high density
disks.</p>
<p>If one track of the floppy disk cannot be read correctly and DIC has
been started via an interactive terminal (e.g. CON:), it will ask to either
skip the failed track or to try to read it again. On noninteractive
terminals these tracks will be skipped by default.<br>For skipped tracks
the appropriate area in the image will be filled with the pattern
"<tt>TDIC</tt>". So it is possible to identify the read error later.</p>
<p>DIC can also read disks partially by using the option <tt>SIZE/K/N</tt>.
If used DIC will ommit the data after the specified size. This may be
useful if the last tracks are unused.</p>
<p>Tracks can be skipped using the option <tt>SKIPTRACK/K/N</tt>.
This is very useful to create images of disks containing a disk based
protection (e.g. RN-Copylocks on track 1).</p>
<p>If the option <tt>PEDANTIC/S</tt> has been specified DIC will quit
immedately if a track is unreadable.</p>
<p>DIC can be interupted at any time by pressing Ctrl-C.</p>
<h4>Installation</h4>
copy it to C: or a similar place
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>To use DIC interactively:
<ul>
<li>open a Shell
<li>enter directory where the images should be stored
<li>type "DIC" and press RETURN
<li>now insert the disks and follow the instructions given by DIC
<li>after the last disk has been read interrupt DIC by pressing Ctrl-C
</ul>
To use DIC in a installation script use the options
<tt>FD=FIRSTDISK/K/N</tt>, <tt>LD=LASTDISK/K/N</tt> and
<tt>PEDANTIC/S</tt>. For disks with physical copy protection use
<tt>SKIPTRACK/K/N</tt>. If possible it's really nice to use <tt>SIZE/K</tt>
to save diskspace all over the world ;-).
<h4>Options</h4>
<table>
<tr><td colspan=2>
<tt>DEVICE,NAME,SKIPTRACK/K,SIZE/K,FD=FIRSTDISK/K/N,LD=LASTDISK/K/N,PEDANTIC/S</tt>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
<tt>DEVICE</tt>
</td><td>
the device from which DIC will read the disks
<br>default "DF0:"
<br>example "RAD:"
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
<tt>NAME</tt>
</td><td>
name for the image to create, if specified DIC will not name the image "Disk.1" and
so on, but uses the specified name. this option sets <tt>FIRSTDISK/K/N</tt> and
<tt>LASTDISK/K/N</tt> to 1, which means that only one disk will be read
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
<tt>SKIPTRACK/K/N</tt>
</td><td>
the tracks specified will not be read, the appropriate area in the disk
image to create is filled with the pattern "<tt>TDIC</tt>", the following
table shows some examples to illustrate the flexible possibilties to
specify tracks
  <table>
  <tr><td>list</td><td>affected tracks</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1-5</td><td>1,2,3,4,5</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2,90</td><td>2,90</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2*2</td><td>2,4,...,156,158</td></tr>
  <tr><td>10-20*5</td><td>10,15,20</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1-5,7,99-104*2</td><td>1,2,3,4,5,7,99,101,103</td></tr>
  </table>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
<tt>SIZE/K</tt>
</td><td>
the size of the image to create, useful if there is an unused area at the end
of the disk, if size is larger than the physical image size it is ignored
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top nowrap>
<tt>FD=FIRSTDISK/K/N</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</td><td>
number of the first disk
<br>default "FD=1"
<br>example "FD=0"
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
<tt>LD=LASTDISK/K/N</tt>
</td><td>
default "LD=999999"
<br>example "LD=3"
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
<tt>PEDANTIC/S</tt>
</td><td>
if specified DIC will immedately quit if a track cannot be read, should be
used in install scripts
</td></tr>
</table>
<h4>Return code</h4>
The return code is set to 0 if all disks from <tt>FD</tt> up to <tt>LD</tt>
are read successfully. Otherwise 10 is returned.
