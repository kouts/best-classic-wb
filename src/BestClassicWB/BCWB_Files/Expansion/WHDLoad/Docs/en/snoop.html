<h3>Snooping</h3>

<h4>What it is</h4> Snooping is a feature of WHDLoad which performs validating
and logging of accesses to the Custom and CIA registers. If <a
href="opt.html#Snoop">Snoop</a> is activated all invalid accesses will create
an Access Fault and the installed program will be terminated. WHDLoad will
show a requester explaining the reason of the fault.

<h4>Custom registers</h4>All read and write accesses to the custom registers
are verified. Invalid accesses are:
<ul>
<li>accesses to nonexistent registers
<li>read accesses to Write Only registers
<li>write accesses to Read Only registers
<li>accesses to Early Read registers
<li>byte write accesses (except <tt>bltcon0l</tt> and <tt>aud*vol+1</tt>)
</ul>
Strobe registers can be read or written. The set of valid Custom registers
varies between OCS (Old ChipSet - A500, A1000, old A2000), ECS (Enhanced ChipSet
- A600, new A2000, A3000) and AGA (Advanced Graphics - A1200, A4000). This is
useful especially to locate bugs in old programs caused by undefined accesses
to new AGA registers.

<p>Using the function <a
href="../autodoc.html#resload_Control">resload_Control</a> and the tags <a
href="../autodoc.html#WHDLTAG_CUST">WHDLTAG_CUST_DISABLE/READ/STROBE/WRITE</a>
the internal configuration of WHDLoad which registers are readable/writable can
be modified. With that illegal accesses can be ignored or legal accesses can be
detected. This should only be used during the development process and not in
public released Slaves.

<h4>CIA registers</h4>With the CIA registers only write accesses are verified.
That means that read accesses to non existent registers in the memory area of
$bfd000...$bfefff won't get detected. For all write accesses the written value
will be saved internally by WHDLoad. For some CIA registers there are special
checks depending on the written value:

<h4>How it works</h4>
If Snoop is enabled, WHDLoad marks the addresses of the Custom and CIA registers as
invalid/write-protected in the MMU translation tree. Because of this, each access to a Custom or CIA
register will result in an Access Fault exception. The exception handler in
WHDLoad handles this exception. First it checks if the access is valid. If the
access is invalid the program will be terminated. If the access is valid and
is a read operation it will be emulated and program execution
continues. If it is a write operation WHDLoad additional saves the value written to
a internal storage.
<br>Because the overhead of the exception and the emulation sequence the
program execution will slow down. How much it slows down depends on the CPU
type, Chip Memory type (16/32-bit) and Stackpointer alignment if Chip
Memory is 32-bit (LongWord aligned or not). It also differs for the access
type (Byte/Word/LongWord, Read/Write). On the 68030 Writes are faster than
Reads (because on reads the stackframe is 92 bytes on writes 32 bytes), on
the 68060 Reads are faster because the emulation for Writes is more
complex.

<h4>Fast Snoop Mode</h4>
The option <a href="opt.html#Snoop">Snoop/S</a> enables the fast snooping. Read accesses will not be
checked. No special checks are performed. This mode may be useful to only
get contents of the Custom registers, e.g. to save a picture using <a
href="sp.html">SP</a>.

<h4>Copper List Scanner</h4>
Since version 13 of WHDLoad also copperlists itself will be checked. The
scanner will be activated on writes to the <tt>coplc</tt> registers if the copper
dma is enabled, or when the installed program enables the coppper dma by
writing the <tt>dmacon</tt> register. The scanner follows the copperlists and
validates all Move instructions by applying the restrictions caused by the
Snoop option (OCS/ECS/AGA). Skip and Wait (except CEND) instructions will be ignored. When it
finds invalid entries the installed program will be terminated. The scanner
follows branches (<tt>copjmp</tt>), detects loops and checks upto 16 sublists. The
Moves in copperlists will be saved in the internal Custom register storage
which is dumped at WHDLoad exit. The scanner is not active in Fast Snoop
Mode.

<h4>Audio Pointer Check</h4>
When option <a href="opt.html#ChkAudPt">ChkAudPt/S</a> is activated WHDLoad
will check that the installed program does write only valid addresses to the
Custom audio DMA pointers. Valid means that the pointer must be inside BaseMem
and unequal 0. Checked are only long write operations. Word writes are
unchecked. This check may be useful to locate problems in audio replay
routines.

<h4>Blitter Priority Check</h4>
When option <a href="opt.html#ChkBltHog">ChkBltHog/S</a> is activated WHDLoad will check that the installed
program does not enable the <tt>BltHog</tt> bit by a write to the <tt>dmacon</tt> register.
The Blitter Priority can cause problems on some hardware configuration in
conjunction with large blitter operations (all channels used).

<h4>Blitter Size Check</h4>
When option <a href="opt.html#ChkBltSize">ChkBltSize/S</a> is activated WHDLoad will check that blitter jobs
do not access any memory outside the BaseMem area. On write accesses to
<tt>bltsize</tt> or <tt>bltsizh</tt> it checks if the line mode is enabled
in <tt>bltcon1</tt>. If the line mode is active it will cancel the size check.
Otherwise WHDLoad will calculate the first and the last word to access for
each activated DMA channel. If one address is outside the BaseMem area the
program will be terminated with a requester. The calculation is designed to
work with all modes (ascending/descending, positive/negative modulos, odd
modulos/pointers).
<br>Beware that the line drawing mode will not be verified and that all blitter
registers can also be written by the copper if <tt>copcon</tt> is set.

<h4>Blitter Wait Check</h4>
When option <a href="opt.html#ChkBltWait">ChkBltWait/S</a> is activated WHDLoad will use a instruction trace
to verify that the installed program does correctly wait for the blitter to
finish before starting a new blitter job. It uses a internal variable which
represents the working state of the blitter. The variable is set when a
write access to the <tt>bltsize</tt> or <tt>bltsizh</tt> occurs and cleared
when read access to the <tt>dmaconr</tt> register is performed. On each
write to a blitter register the value of the internal variable is checked,
if it states a running blitter job the installed program will be terminated
and WHDLoad will report the PC of the last started blitter job together
with the actual access.
<br>There are two major bottlenecks of this feature. First blitter usage
via the copper are not checked and second the use of blitter interrupts
will cause the check routine to report errors without necessity.

<h4>Color Burst Check</h4>
When option <a href="opt.html#ChkColBst">ChkColBst/S</a> is activated WHDLoad
checks that on each write to the <code>custom.bplcon0</code> register the
<code>color</code> bit is set. Some hardware especially flickerfixer require
that this bit is set to output a proper video signal. For best compatibility
this bit should always be set. Checked are direct writes to
<code>custom.bplcon0</code> and writes via copperlists. 

<h4>Copper Control Check</h4>

When option <a href="opt.html#ChkCopCon">ChkCopCon/S</a> is activated WHDLoad
checks that on each write to the <code>custom.copcon</code> register the bit #1
is not set. This bit enables the ability of the Copper to write to the Blitter
registers. It may sometimes useful to detect if programs use the Copper to
control DMA activities.

<h4>Future</h4>
It is planned to implement features like Freezing and Iconifing.
For these, Snoop is a requirement. Therefore it is
recommended for install authors to check their installs with Snoop to secure
future compatibility.
<h4>Requirements</h4>
An MMU is required for the Snoop feature. Also WHDLoad must <a
href="mmu.html#usercontrol">use</a> the MMU, therefore <a
href="opt.html#MMU">MMU/S</a> must be enabled on 68030 machines.
