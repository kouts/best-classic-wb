<h3>Installation</h3>
The easiest way to install WHDLoad and the supplied tools is to use the
Installer script provided.
<p>The most important thing is that the tools and WHDLoad are accessible
without a path specification. Therefore the recommended place is "C:". WHDLoad
can also be installed in the same directory where the program is located
(notice that in the Project Icons of the Examples only "WHDLoad" is used,
without any path).
<p>The tools "DIC", "RawDIC" and "Patcher" should always be installed because
these are required by many installs during the installation process. They are
not required at runtime, after the installation has completed.
