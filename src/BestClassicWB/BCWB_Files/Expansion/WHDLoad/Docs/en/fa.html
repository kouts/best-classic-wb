<h3>FindAccess * Find Access to a memory location</h3>
This tool will load the specified file and scans it for accesses to a given
address. It will find all absolute and relative 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit
references. It has been written to analyse the coredump files. It is similar
to the Freezer command FA but will not disassemble the access but show it as a
pure hex dump.
<h4>Installation</h4>
FindAccess is only contained in the <tt>DEV</tt> archive, not in the
<TT>USR</tt> archive <br>copy it to C: or a similar place
<h4>Usage</h4>
I use the following alias (added to my S:Shell-Startup) to search in the last
memory dump written by WHDLoad:
<p><tt>alias fa FindAccess C:.whdl_memory</tt></p>
so I can open a Shell and type for example:
<p><tt>fa $15000</tt></p>
and will get the output:
<p><tt>FindAccess 1.2 (17-Jan-99 14:45:18) by Bert Jahn
<br>loading file <B>Workbench:CE/.whdl_memory</B>
<br>scanning accesses to $15000 (86016)  file: $0-$80000
<br>Relative  Word at $ 14240 -> 06C00000 07C00000 <B>0DC0</B> 00000CC0 000004C0
</tt></p>
<h4>Options</h4>

</td><td>
the name of the file to scan

</td><td>
the access address you search for, you can use simple expressions like "$5000"
= "20480" = " -$Ff +-33+ 19512+$4e8" (prefix "$" for hexadecimal numbers,
supported operators are "+" and "-", unary and binary)
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
<tt>ORG</tt>
</td><td>
the logical start address of the file, if not specified $0 is used, you can
use same simple expressions as with ADDRESS/A
