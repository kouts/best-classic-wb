***  18.9 (01.05.2023)
	- fix:	fixed possible race condition when using XPK compressed files
		and multiple data directories, if a compressed file with the
		same name was contained in two consecutive data dirs and was
		the last compressed in the first dir and the first compressed
		one in the subsequent dir it was preloaded two times and the
		second one got visible to the installed program, this has been
		corrected now
	- fix:	the Slave structure flag EmulDivZero now also works on 68010,
		in previous version it always faulted (missing support for
		different stack frame format on the 68010)
	- fix:	DIC option SkipTrack was broken in version 1.2, now fixed with
		version 1.3 (CFou!)
	- new:	new local option ExecuteArgs to supply arguments to the
		scripts/programs called via the ExecuteCleanup/Startup/...
		options, using this it becomes possible to control the
		behavior of the scripts in single install without the need to
		have many different Execute* scripts
	- new:	if started from Workbench WHDLoad now opens a window
		CON:////WHDLoad .../AUTO/CLOSE/WAIT for the ExecuteCleanup and
		ExecuteStartup scripts which opens if there is any output
	- chg:	option Cache/S can also be specified in the global
		configuration file (Tomaz)
	- new:	the kick13 emulation now also supports the WHDCtrl resident
		command which can be used to quit WHDLoad, because the boot
		CLI under 1.3 does not run resident commands a patch has been
		implemented to add this feature (Hexaae)
	- fix:	now resload_ListFiles is able to list the install root
		directory also when listing from cached files, this was broken
		since the introduction of the feature to list cached files in
		release 18.7, which broke for example Gauntlet3 (issue #6077)
	- fix:	depending on the already used chip memory WHDLoad has
		corrupted read/write data (all io related Resload functions),
		if the file cache feature wasn't used (NoWriteCache or
		NoFileCache set), this may have corrupted saved data! this bug
		has been introduced in WHDLoad release 18.4, thanks to DJ Mike
		for reporting/testing (issue #6078)
	- chg:	the options ExecutePostDisk and ExecutePreDisk are now working
		as intended/documented, previously they were called only once
		(issue #5880)
	- fix:	RawDIC has been updated to version 6.1 which fixes
		compatibility with imager slaves which used DoubleInc and one
		track too much in the tracklist (e.g. Beast)
	- fix:	made EmulChk working on 68010 (issue #6137)

***  18.8 (28.05.2022)
	- fix:	new created files in sub directories which are cached are now
		correctly reported via Examine (issue #5536)
	- fix:	when new created cached files are deleted WHDLoad no longer
		tries to delete them on disk
	- chg:	the memory of detected freezers is now cachable if MMU is used
	- new:	the gadgets in the splash window can be controlled via
		keyboard and joystick now, up/down selects the gadgets via
		mouse move and left/right switches the gadgets

***  18.7 (15.12.2021)
	- new:	if a kickstart is requested by the Slave (ws_kickname) and the
		current default	keymap is different from default Kickstart
		keymap (usa/usa1) WHDLoad provides the current default keymap
		as a virtual file called 'WHDLoad.keymap'
		kickemu kick13.s and kick31.s got a new option called
		SETKEYBOARD which loads and activates the 'WHDLoad.keymap'
	- fix:	avoid a possible crash if no kickstart image could be found
	- chg:	the check for a read-only filesystem to ignore write
		operations now checks the first data directory instead the
		current directory of WHDLoad
	- new:	sources/whdload/lowlevel.s has been added to be used with
		kickemu, it is based on the OS3.1 lowlevel.library and provides
		a way to avoid the disk based library and save some memory, the
		kickemu option INIT_LOWLEVEL uses it now instead loading the
		disk based library
	- fix:	corrected the key repeat fix in kick31.s
	- chg:	resload_ListFiles no longer requires a switch to the OS if
		Preload	was able to cache all files by using the file cache to
		fill the buffer with filenames
	- new:	support for virtual filesystem plugins (VFS) added,
		if one of the Data/K objects specified is not a directory but
		a file WHDLoad will attempt to load PROGDIR:WHDLoad.VFS and
		uses this interface to load data for such data objects, the
		VFS-ABI/API is described in "include/whdvfs.i", a VFS
		implementation which currently supports lha and zip-archives
		can be obtained from http://github.com/temisu/WHDLoadArchiveFS
		Thanks a lot to Teemu Suutari for his great work!
		VFS objects are always read-only for WHDLoad, so either use
		SavePath/K or a first data directory which isn't VFS to
		allow WHDLoad to save something
	- fix:	cursor down in the CLI usage message is working again in the
		standard AmigaShell (issue #5146)
	- chg:	DIC 1.2: if a track has a read error and option Skip is active
		and the device is controlled by trackdisk.devices, DIC
		switches to sector reads now to be able to read more good data
		in case not all sectors on this track are unreadable
	- chg:	WHDLoad now returns with an error code = 5 if the Preload
		operation has been canceled by pressing the Esc key while
		the splash window is open (issue #5171)
	- chg:	a new option NoWriteInfo/N has been added as local and global
		option, if set WHDLoad will not update/write any .info
		files (issue #5153)
	- chg:	WHDLoad now resets custom.serper on exit to stop a possible
		MIDI/MT32 playback via the serial line (JOTD)
	- new:	option WriteCache/S added to overwrite global option
		NoWriteCache/S (issue #5263)
	- new:	WHDLoad is now able to cache also write operations to new
		created files or existing files which grow in size. For that
		the option PreLoad must be active and there must be enough
		memory available to preload all files. WHDLoad will then
		allocate the largest free memory block remaining and use this
		memory to dynamically cache new files or growing existing
		files. The cached files are written to disk on WHDLoad exit.
	- new:	kickemu kick31.asm can be enabled to activate an internal
		resident command WHDCtrl which can be used to quit WHDLoad
	- upd:	the documentation for czech, dansk and french are in sync
		again; thanks to all translators: Manel Beltrán, Bored Seal,
		Bruno Skjold Andersen, Miguel Dilaj, Mikko Heinonen, Psygore,
		Marius Danilewicz

***  18.6 (22.09.2020)
	- new:	WHDLoad now disables interrupts of graphics cards under
		the Picasso96 software. This should solve problems with
		Spectrum cards and newer P96 releases (issue #2598). Thanks
		to Thomas Richter for providing useful information.
	- upd:	Manual translations are in sync again for catalan and czech.
	- new:	Kickemu kick31.s can be instructed to load/init the custom
		nonvolatile.s via option INIT_NONVOLATILE.
	- fix:	nonvolatile.s now correctly works on searching nonexistent
		items in a existing nvram file
	- chg:	In kickemu kick13.s a waitblit has been added to avoid
		problems with the gfx.Text patch (Psygore).
	- chg:	The provided source keyboard.s now uses cia timers instead the
		raster beam for the keyboard acknowledge delay.
	- fix:	Access faults of size word to address -1 and of size long to
		addresses -3..-1 are now reliable detected and reported.
		In earlier releases: on 68030: when ExpMem was used these were
		undetected, on 68040: when ExpMem was used and vector base was
		not write protected (e.g. Freezer detected, Snoop*,
		resload_Protect	used) these were undetected, if vector base
		was protected a	fault inside WHDLoad was reported, on 68060:
		these were always correctly reported
	- chg:	To reduce the likelihood that resload functions get
		interrupted by other calls to resload functions, some resload
		functions which usually take not much execution time, have
		been changed to be not interruptible anymore.
		The following resload functions have been changed that way:
		Abort, SetCACR, FlushCache, Control, Protect#?, SetCPU,
		GetCustom, VSNPrintF and Log.
		In general the option NoResInt/S can be used to avoid problems
		with interrupted resload calls at the cost of possible sound/
		graphics distortions when interrupts are disabled for a longer
		time.
	- chg:	The provided source sources/whdload/savegame.s is now fully
		pc-relative. It contains also additional fixes for interrupt
		acknowledge and AGA compatibility (JOTD/ross).
	- chg:	The inplace decruncher for the old RNC1 format has been
		improved to support files which need a larger distance
		(Heimdall/JOTD).
	- chg:	The kick31.s now prefers a A600 kickstart image if NO68020 is
		set. It fails now if there is only a 68000/010 and a
		A1200/A4000 kickstart image was loaded (JOTD).
	- fix:	When using kickfs.s the dos.library function
		Open(MODE_READWRITE) now performs correctly on Kickstart 3.1
		by creating a non-existent file. On Kickstart 1.3 the old
		behavior remains to not create a file.
	- chg:	If a call to resload_Examine is attempted without the flag
		WHDLF_Examine has been set in the Slave structure WHDLoad now
		terminates with an appropriate error message (JOTD).
	- chg:	The kickemu kick12.s, kick13.s and kick31.s has been modified
		to automatically set the Slave flag WHDLF_Examine if HDINIT is
		set (JOTD).
	- chg:	When using resload_Relocate with tags CHIPPTR/FASTPTR and the
		specified chip/fast memory location would result in an
		overlapping with base executable WHDLoad now gives a useful
		error message (JOTD).
	- fix:	Instead of waiting for a long video frame WHDLoad now forces a
		long frame before starting the Slave. This fixes startup
		problems on Kickstart 3.0 and an interlace video mode
		(issue #4798).
	- chg:	MMU-table creation has been reworked. It is now faster and
		uses less memory.
	- new:	Support for ACA-freezer added.
	- chg:	if "*" is specified for the Slave to load WHDLoad searchs the
		current directory for a file with the pattern "#?.slave" and
		will use the first file matching (Toni Wilen)

***  18.5 (09.03.2019)
	- fix:	due bug in memory swap routine 18.4 crashed on returning to
		the os, this has been fixed (issue #4084)

***  18.4 (20.02.2019)
	- fix:	option NoReq/S has also effect now for errors occuring in
		conjunction with option Data/K (issue #3690)
	- fix:	patch list command PL_GA fixed in the WHDLoadCD32
	- fix:	fixed wrong results with resload_ExNext introduced in 18.3,
		e.g. game Ork Attack (Psygore)
	- fix:	in version 18.3 a CMD_STOP/FLUSH/START of input.device was
		added, this seems to cause problems on some configurations,
		to avoid them the code has been removed again
	- chg:	cpu cache handling in kickemu changed, there are new options
		CACHECHIP and CACHECHIPDATA, the behavior of option CACHE has
		been reverted to pre WHDLoad release 18.3, with option CACHE
		all caches are enabled for expansion memory if MMU is used,
		with option CACHECHIP the instruction cache will be enabled
		for all memory independent from from WHDLoad's MMU usage,
		option CACHECHIPDATA will enable data and instruction cache
		for all memory, if no CACHE* option is set the cache are
		disabled now, in previous releases the cache setup wasn't
		modified which resulted in WHDLoad's default cache setup where
		inst/data cache is enabled for ExpMem/Slave if MMU used -
		similar to option option CACHE where additionally the 68060
		stuff is enabled (branch cache, superscalar, write buffer),
		please consult also the provided kick.readme
	- chg:	kickemu kick13.s has been modified to work with data cache in
		chip memory, gfx.Text now uses the cpu to clear the temporary
		buffer instead the blitter
	- new:	macro PL_STR0 added to the patch list commands which will
		write the given string plus a 0-byte to the destination
	- new:	italian keymap added to the docs (thanks Luca Longone)
	- fix:	kickfs: with IOCACHE to order of writes is now preserved, in
		previous releases it was not, which could cause switches to
		the operation system on resload_SaveFileOffset because offsets
		outside the current filesize
	- chg:	if SplashDelay=0 and ConfigDelay>0 the splash window is
		opened if there is a config (Juuso Salmijärvi)
	- chg:	the local option Config now overwrites a config string
		contained in the Slave
	- chg:	option Preload/S can also be used in the global configuration
		file
	- fix:	using Snoop on the 68030 the fire button bits in cia.ddra can
		be set to output mode now (reading joypad), previously this
		was only allowed on 68040/60 (StingRay)
	- chg:	BaseMemory is now allocated in possible three parts to reduce
		memory requirements if higher areas of chip memory are already
		used by the system
	- new:	a segtracker modul has been added to all kickemu variants,
		equal to the known utility SegTracker by Michael Sinz this
		will track all loaded executables, WHDLoad will use this
		information to display name and offset in all error messages,
		this will make it easier to locate causes for malfunctions in
		kickemu installed programs
	- chg:	the calculation of exec.ChkSum in kick12/13.s has been fixed
	- fix:	if SegTracker was used and no matching segment was found
		WHDLoad displayed sometimes some garbage, this has been fixed
	- chg:	all the sources provided by JOTD has been updated to the
		latest level, nonvolatile.s has been removed because the
		sources are now using the nonvolatile.s provided by WHDLoad,
		thanks to JOTD
	- chg:	WHDLoadGCI allows now opening a new memory window from the
		address under the cursor in a memory window, a bug in partial
		extraction of Base/ExpMemory has been fixed
	- chg:	a patch has been added to all kickemus to disable the key
		repeat of the input.device after a switch to the operating
		system, this should avoid problems on first time save
		operations triggered by a keypress
	- new:	the splash window can also be closed now pressing the fire
		button on the joystick in port #1
	- new:	a new special quit key has been added which quits by pressing
		Reverse, Forward and Play together on a joypad
	- chg:	WHDLoad no longer tries to open the audio.device, there was
		not much benefit from it and to leave it avoids any requesters
		if already open by another application

***  18.3 (06.04.2017)
	- chg:	don't check for read-only-filesystem if option SavePath is
		used (issue #3355)
	- fix:	if option SavePath is used and the save path is not yet
		created WHDLoad will no longer try to delete files in the
		normal data directories if resload_DeleteFile is called
	- fix:	resload_SaveFileOffset now correctly works on files which are
		not preloaded and not yet present in the SavePath, in older
		releases dos error #203 was reported (issue #3355)
	- chg:	the behavior of the option CACHE in kickemu
		(sources/whdload/kick*.s) has been changed, previously it set
		the chip memory non cacheable (NC) now it sets it cacheable
		write-through (WT), recompiling Slaves using this option will
		change this for the resulting Slaves, for machines with cpu
		caches and no MMU otherwise no caches are enabled at all by
		WHDLoad
	- chg:	splash window corrected for non standard window borders
		(Mikhail Malyshev)
	- fix:	resload_DeleteFile reworked, no longer supports deleting
		directories, delete operation is cached if file was preloaded,
		now correctly works together with SavePath/K option
	- chg:	checking for a read-only filesystem is performed after
		executing a possible ExecuteStartup now (Stephane Julien)
	- chg:	kickemu now uses the host system bplcon0 to init gb_bplcon0,
		this should preserve genlock/lace setup (issue #2858),
		WHDLoad itself also use gb_bplcon0 for the initial custom
		setup
	- fix:	the interrupt redirect feature of ACA now correctly works with
		programs depending on the supervisor bit in the interrupt
		stack frame, this should fix problems with install using the
		kickstart emulation (Toni Wilen)
	- chg:	on 68060 the store/load bypass is no longer disabled if the
		cpu revision is >= 5
	- new:	support for Vampire/Apollo added, will be detected as 68040
		now (older WHDLoad detected a 68020 because the presence of
		MSP and CAAR registers), MMU is always disabled
	- fix:	kickemu now correctly enables the fpu via resload_SetCPU if
		NEEDFPU is set

***  18.2 (23.12.2015)
	- chg:	the WHDLoad install script speaks german now
	- fix:	some small fixes in the Autodoc file (Psygore)
	- fix:	small fix in the supplied ITD program to avoid problems while
		detecting the destination device
	- new:	RoadShow added to the example Startup/Cleanup scripts
	- fix:	dumping of loaded files via resload_DiskLoad was broken
	- fix:	due to small internal buffer the argument parsing when started
		from the CLI did not detect a bad argument (Psygore)
	- fix:	the blitter wait check (ChkBlitWait/S) now resets the internal
		run flag also at word reads to dmaconr on the 68030,
		previously only bytes did that (StingRay)
	- chg:	WHDLoad no longer requests a keyfile and it is no longer
		possible to register WHDLoad, if you have a keyfile it is
		still loaded/checked and your name will be displayed in the
		splash window, Thanks to all registered users!

***  18.1 (19.04.2015)
	- new:	update check added: when a network connection is available
		WHDLoad will check via a HTTP request if a newer version
		exists on the WHDLoad webpage for the used Slave and WHDLoad,
		supports a proxy with optional basic authentication via option
		Proxy/K, to disable any network access the option NoNetwork/S
		can be used
		uses sha256 implementation by Robert Leffmann, thanks!
	- chg:	dumping loaded files using bit #31 set in the disk number via
		resload_DiskLoad will now use the offset in ExpMem in the
		created file name, also the written files will go through the
		file cache to avoid recurring switches to the operating system

***  18.0 (04.12.2014)
	- fix:	WHDLoad lock up happen when FullChip/S is used and
		exec.MaxLocMem is equal to BaseMemSize fixed
	- fix:	ExpChip/S and FullChip/S cannot be enabled together, if both
		are set FullChip/S will be silently disabled (Psygore)
	- chg:	option NoTrapHandler/S has been removed
	- fix:	race condition fixed which sometimes caused a 'Privilege
		Violation Exception' when a Resload function was called from
		Usermode and got interrupted during the internal switch to
		Supervisor mode and then trace exception was used from the
		installed program, seen especially in installs using kick13
		emu and performing a lot of disk io, fixes issue #2094 and
		connected ones
	- chg:	the log file created by the FileLog/S facility has been
		renamed from .whdl_filelog to .whdl_log
	- new:	function resload_Log which puts custom messages into the log
		file .whdl_log, uses the same file as the FileLog/S facility
		and requires that FileLog/S option is set so that messages
		will be written
		this function is intended to make it easier to debug/follow
		alien code by adding trace messages to dump the execution
		state at useful places
	- new:	option LogBuffer/K/N to control the size of the internal
		buffer allocated for log messages by FileLog/S and
		resload_Log
	- new:	function resload_VSNPrintF implementing a exec.RawDoFmt/
		sprintf	like string formatting routine
	- new:	kickfs.s has new option SNOOPFS which will cause in
		conjunction with HDINIT all dos packets after processing to
		be logged using resload_Log, the supplied perl script
		chkunlock.pl can be used to search the log file for missing
		dos.UnLock and dos.Close calls
	- new:	using the function resload_Control and the tags
		WHDLTAG_CUST_DISABLE/READ/WRITE/STROBE the allowed custom
		registers for Snoop*/S can be modified now
	- chg:	ReSource support files updated to cover recent WHDLoad
		extensions
	- new:	added XAD support to the installer template script
	- chg:	external program SP to save pictures from dump files has been
		improved to better support AGA screens (ddf, fmode, bplcon)
	- chg:	on the 68030 the instruction burst is now always enabled if
		the instruction cache is enabled (Psygore)
	- chg:	the 68040 processor is now fully supported regarding the
		special mmu features (Snoop, resload_Protect), the
		implementation was planned since years, it was a lot of work
		because	the handling is very different to the 68030 und 68060,
		although I'm unsure if this feature will be used much, I'm
		happy to have it completed now
	- chg:	option ChkAudPt/S is also supported on the 68030 and 68040 now
	- chg:	the interrupt redirect feature of ACA500/Zeus is not used when
		option NoVBRMove/S is set
	- chg:	PreloadSize/N will also be set by WHDLoad if ws_DontCache is
		used in the Slave
	some more end user related improvements are planned for the next
	release :-)

***  17.2 (01.12.2013)
	- fix:	cancelling directory preload (in the splash window pressing
		Esc or changing a option forcing restart) could cause memory
		list corruption
	- new:	support for Zeus68k pseudo vbr added, allows to quit by key
		similar like a moved vector base, but only on interrupts not
		on exceptions
	- new:	on AGA machines all color registers are read from the custom
		chips and written to the dump file
	- fix:	WHDLoadCD32 works again with resload_DiskLoad, was broken in
		version 17.1 (issue #2633)
	- chg:	utility ITD can now read files larger than 4 GiB (e.g. on
		SFS\2) and write to larger devices using TD64
	- chg:	alignment for patch lists (resload_Patch/Seg) is now verified
		by WHDLoad to avoid problems on 68000/10
	- chg:	the check for valid custom.aud*ptr introduced in version 17.1
		can now be enabled via the new option ChkAudPt/S
	- fix:	on Kickstart 2.0 (V37) option NoMemReverse/S is now always
		active to avoid problems which could lead to freezing during
		Preload or other memory allocations
	- chg:	memory allocations improved if NoMemReverse/S is active, now
		these will succeed also if memory below BaseMemSize is free
		by trying to allocate until memory is above
	- fix:	preload progress bar fixed on Kickstart 2.0 (V37), was using
		a V39 only utility.library function
	- new:	added IF/ELSE/ENDIF conditional blocks to patch lists to
		simplify the handling of patches depending on ButtonWait/S and
		Custom1-5/N options (resload_Patch/Seg)
	- chg:	detection of HRTmon builtin WinUAE improved to support if MMU
		protection is enabled with WHDLoad (CFou!)
	- chg:	options NTSC/PAL can be set global and local now, where the
		local one (CLI/Tooltype) will overwrite the global one
		(configuration file S:WHDLoad.prefs)
	- new:	WHDLoad now sets the screen mode in HRTmon to the video mode
		specified for the installed program, with that HRTmon will
		always uses the same video mode (PAL/NTSC) as WHDLoad, for
		correct operation at least HRTmon version 2.35 is required
	- chg:	audio.device is only opened when present in execs device list,
		this saves some memory if it isn't initilized already
	- chg:	install script template now supports also the diskimage
		device by Fredrik Wikstrom (Psygore)
	- chg:	option FullChip/S can also set globally now
	- new:	support for interrupt vector redirect feature of ACA500 on
		68000 added
	- chg:	added a kludge to preserve the largest free memory block until
		PreLoad in situations where multiple small free blocks are
		available to increase the likelihood of being able to cache a
		large disk image

***  17.1 (06.10.2012)
	- fix:	formatting of termination reason string in register dump fixed
		on very long texts (Psygore)
	- fix:	if the vbr is moved by WHDLoad the interrupts of levels 4-6
		(vectors $70..$78) are directly forwarded to the installed
		program now, in previous releases all the sanity checks and
		checks for the keyboard were done in each interrupt which has
		increased the latency and duration of the interrupts, now
		these checks are only performed in interrupt levels 1-3 or
		if the option CheckInts/S is used for all levels
		it seems that the increased amount of code put into the
		interrupts by the later WHDLoad versions has caused problems
		with several games, this is hopefully fixed now and these
		games will work with the current WHDLoad as good as with
		versions 16.8 or 16.9
	- fix:	on a 68020 the default cache setup was instruction cache
		enable, this bug has been introduced in version 17.0, now the
		default is again disabled (Toni Wilen)
	- chg:	the icon started from is only written if any gadget has been
		pressed, previously it were written everytime if Config or
		Expert was active (Graham)
	- fix:	prevented a bug when FileLog/S will be disabled via the splash
		window
	- new:	resload_DiskLoad can now dump all read files, see autodoc
	- new:	SnoopOCS/ECS/AGA/S checks also that writes to custom.aud*ptr
		are not outside BaseMem and are not equal zero, check is only
		performed on 68060 (Psygore)
	- chg:	WHDLoad now detects a filesize difference between the
		directory scan used for resload_Examine/ExNext requested by
		WHDLF_Examine and the file Preload, this may reveal filesystem
		problems in conjunction with dos.ExAll, e.g. ffs 39.x
		(issue #2575)
	- chg:	documentation regarding patch lists in include and autodoc
		files improved
	- fix:	on chip memory only machines with Kickstart 3.0 or better
		slaves with WHDLF_Examine failed on building the directory
		cache due problems with exec.CreatePool (Psygore)

***  17.0 (14.08.2011)
	- chg:	documentation about Snoop feature now explains in detail which
		cia registers are checked in which way (StingRay)
	- chg:	the install script template function P_AskDisk is additional
		able to	check for disks which contain a named file instead
		only by volume name
	- chg:	the joypad emulation in kickemu 3.1 now supports a force
		option to disable the auto sensing of lowlevel.library
	- fix:	kickfs.s now properly supports reading and writing to the same
		file handle if IOCACHE is used
	- new:	support/detection of special HRTmon builtin WinUAE added
		(monitor must be entered one time before WHDLoad can see it!)
	- fix:	when file for Preload/S was larger than the largest free
		memory block this could lead to an DOS error #205 after all
		remaining files have been preloaded, this bug has been
		introduced in version 16.9, issue #2154
	- chg:	on option NoResInt/S WHDLoad checks and terminates if blitter
		is active on entering via a resload function
	- chg:	trap hook now checks if vector is odd and aborts then
	- chg:	if option NoMMU/S is active WHDLoad now more correctly checks
		the actual MMU setup and warns about translations of 0..3000
	- chg:	amount of disassembled code lines increased (Psygore)

		by Psygore, (moveq #-x; cmp/add/and/move/bset/bchg/... #$nnxx;
		bitfield with offset 0)
	- fix:	crashes on M-Tec 630 boards without FPU fitted caused by the
		FPU detection inside WHDLoad fixed, board causes 'coprocessor
		protocol violation's instead of 'line-f emulator', thanks to
		Die BORG for lending the hardware
	- chg:	there are separate Resload versions for 00-20/30/40/60 now,
		which enlarges the WHDLoad executable but saves memory at
		runtime (overlayed)
	- new:	progress bar for Preload/S operation added, WHDLoad will
		remember PreloadSize/S itself as ToolType if started from the
		Workbench

	- new:	WHDLoad supports the compression file formats of CrunchMania
		with the resload functions resload_Decrunch and resload_Load-
		FileDecrunch (Psygore)
	- chg:	the way WHDLoad checks for keyboard strokes (QuitKey,
		FreezeKey, ...) has been slightly modified, in earlier
		versions it has checked for keydown strokes, now it only
		reacts on keyup events; if the Slave checks itself for
		keyboard events	the installed program may still quit on
		keydowns
	- chg:	the ws_keydebug entry in the Slave structure is now ignored,
		the debug key must be explictly set via arguments
	- fix:	it's now possible to use QuitKey/DebugKey=0 (Psygore)
	- chg:	as long as the splash window is open pressing Esc will break
		the Preload/S process and quit WHDLoad
	- chg:	pressing Space/Return/Enter will close the splash window and
		start the installed program immediate after completion of
		Preload/S
	- new:	in Expert/S mode the splash window now contains some buttons
		to switch debugging related options of WHDLoad which gets
		saved/deleted in the icon if started from the Workbench

		of buttons to be displayed on the splash window to control
		the ButtonWait/S and Custom1-5/K/N options
		to be able to configure	existing Slaves the option Config/K

	- new:	using the option ConfigDelay/K/N the time can be specified
		howlong the splash window is displayed if there are buttons
		on it (Config/Expert)
	- chg:	if SplashDelay/K/N is -1 a start button is added to the splash
		window and the window remains open until pressed
	- chg:	the kickstart images will be searched also in the alternative
		path WHDCOMMON: (M.C.Battilana)

	68040 MMU code is incomplete in this release because being reworked
	to support full MMU features, resload_Protect should work but Snoop
	will lock the machine

		generated by this, thanks to jtorrance and Toni Wilen
	- new:	commands BKPT and BELL added to resload_Patch/Seg to set a
		breakpoint (enter freezer) and show a visual bell
	- chg:	handling of the internal directory cache for resload_Examine/
		ExNext changed, so that new created files will not be the
		first entry in the directory
		this fixes problems with programs which do not correctly
		perform a Examine before each directory scan, e.g. Castles2
		(JOTD)

		without arguments has been fixed for the options Cache/S and
		DCache/S (Hexaae)

		WHDLoad v14.1 cause to crash under some conditions
	- chg:	resload_GetFileSize(Dec) added to the FileLog/S feature
	- fix:	resload_SaveFileOffset has written bad size if file wasn't
		preloaded in WHDLoad v14.1, that may corrupt existing
		images/game files! (thanks to Codetapper for report)

***  14.1 (29.04.2001)
	- chg:	$dff1fe (noop) is also a valid writeable custom register now
		(Codetapper)
	- new:	SP correctly rips EHB pictures now (MrLarmer)
	- fix:	problems with some third party keybords after exiting WHDLoad
		removed
	- new:	option TimeOut/N let WHDLoad / installed program quit after a
		specified time, requires cooperation of the installed program
		(untouched ciaa.ciatod)
	- fix:	problems with resload_Abort and DOS-Errors fixed (Jeff)
	- new:	TDREASON_FAILMSG to quit using a self defined message
		(MrLarmer)
	- new:	all write operations will now be cached in memory if possible
		to omit unnecessary switches to the OS, require that the file
		to write to is already in the file cache, to avoid this
		behavior the option NoWriteCache/S has been added, to
		completely disable this feature the option can also set in the
		global configuration file
	- new:	all data files can be compressed using XPK now, files will be
		decompressed on Preload/S, there must be enough free store to
		cache XPK files otherwise WHDLoad will quit, files can be
		compressed/encrypted multiple times, decrypting requires
		reqtools.library v38
	- chg:	differences in Snoop regarding ciab.prb between 68030 and
		68060 removed, checks for MTR/SEL/STEP on both cpu's now
		(Codetapper)

		writing to cop1lc/cop2lc/dmacon)
	- chg:	link/unlk/pea has been added to the IST (Mr.Larmer)
	- chg:	more useful output on Speed.Slave if MMU is unavailable
		(Harry)

		the current language set in the system, uses and requires
		lowlevel.library to be installed
	- chg:	WHDLoad no longer tries to write to read-only filesystems, so
		games can be played also from cdrom when they will usual save
		highscores or similar data
	- chg:	install templates prepared for high-scores file, WHDLoad stack
		increased (Codetapper)
	- fix:	detection of UAE (AttnFlags) works now
	- new:	commands PA and NOP added for resload_Patch (Codetapper)
	- chg:	tool SP to save pictures from dump files: copper disassembler

		list scanner could lock WHDLoad on return from OS to installed
		program)
	- chg:	WHDInfo 1.20 by Codetapper included in the developer package
	- fix:	better compatibility on Kickstart 2.0, no longer freezes the
		Workbench after exiting WHDLoad, the reason was cia.alarm
		values, because I don't know how to restore them to the
		original values WHDLoad no loger touches them, that means
		also there are no defined start values on entering the
		installed program anymore and there may be too problems on
		Kickstart 2.0 if the installed program writes the cia.alarm
		values (probably less than 5% of all games)

***  13.0 (21.12.2000)
	- fix:	debug key handling fixed (was broken when Expert was used in
		global config and no debug key was specified and the Slave has
		used a default of 0) (Jeff)
	- fix:	autodoc - mistakes regarding KEYTRANS and resload_GetFileSize
		corrected (Codetapper)
	- fix:	bug in WHDLoad 12.0 fixed when using NoMMU/S and memory

		independend of the selected button
	- fix:	bug removed in resload_Patch and command Skip when using a
		distance of 2
	- fix:	splash window background fixed for 16/24-bit screens

		longer overwritten by resload functions, new chapter in the
		documentation regarding cpu cache handling
	- new:	flag WHDLF_ClearMem to cause WHDLoad to simply clear BaseMem
		and ExpMem instead of init them with $CCCCCCCC/$DDDDDDDD
		(Codetapper)

		installed program will only displayed if option Expert/S is
		enabled (Psygore)
	- fix:	compatibility risk in EmulTrap removed
	- chg:	Snoop*/S features reworked:
		- fast Snoop/S mode added, read accesses will not be verified,
		  uses a bit faster routines on write accesses
		- special features can be activated separately, new Options
		  ChkBltWait/S, ChkBltSize/S, ChkBltHog/S, ChkColBst/S
		- special features can be enabled/disabled at runtime via
		  resload_Control
		68030:
		- copperlistscanner implemented

		exceptions to the handler of the installed program if the
		vbr is moved (requested by Bored Seal)
	- new:	tag WHDLTAG_KEYTRANS_GET to get a table for rawkey to ascii
		conversion reflecting the system keyboard configuration

	- fix:	the texts contained in the install templates have been
		fixed for some spelling errors (thanks to Codetapper)
	- new:	some small improvements to SP
	- chg:	WHDLoad no longer terminates on Byte Writes to the audio
		volume registers when Snoop*/S is active, these accesses are
		invalid but used in many replayers and it should not be
		neccessary to fix them all

***  11.2 (04.06.2000)
	- fix:	the "CACR modified" check introduced in v11.0 was broken
		on 68020 machines, now it should work properly on all cpu's

		CACR has been modified, on detection the installed program
		will terminated

***  10.6 (01.03.2000)
	- new:	when using Snoop*/S on 68060, accesses to custom register
		using the SSP in predecrement or postincrement address mode
		will detected and appropriate requester will be displayed,
		such accesses must be patched to make Snoop*/S working on
		68060
	- fix:	WHDLoad no longer quits if the SSP is equal to the end of
		ExpMem on calling a resload function
	- chg:	DIC can skip multiple tracks now

	- chg:	sources and includes reworked a bit, better support for
		different assemblers

***  10.4 (13.10.1999)

		installs have crashed on saving games/highscores (thanks to
		MIcK for report)
	- fix:	WHDLoad no longer crashes if Snoop*/S will be enabled on
		68040 equipped machines (thanks to Joona Palaste for report)

***  10.3 (22.09.1999)
	- fix:	ws_CurrentDir in conjuction with slaves and ws_Version < 4 did
		not work in WHDLoad v10.2 (e.g. MegaLoMania installion slave,
		thanks to Ungi for report), now it works again
	- chg:	parts of the exception handlers rewritten, a detected Freezer
		will be also activated on Access Fault, Privilege Violation
		and Unimplemented Integer Instruction; that simplifies
		debugging
	- chg:	WHDload is overlayed now, that saves some memory at runtime
		and shortens the executable
	- new:	emulation of CMP2 for 68060 added (e.g. Overkill/Mindscape,

	- chg:	SP has got some new options
	- fix:	a bug in sources/whdload/stfix.s removed
	- chg:	resload_Relocate uses less stack now
	- new:	function resload_ProtectSMC to automically detect self
		modifying code (see autodoc)
	- new:	function resload_SetCPU to allow more accurate control over
		the cachebility of certain memory regions and to allow
		control over 68060 specific cpu configuration
	- chg:	option NoDCache has been removed (simplify cache management)
	- new:	function resload_Patch to handle patchlists, i'm wondering
		why this hasn't implemented earlier :), useful especially
		to patch stuff in expansion memory
	- fix:	whole decruncher stuff reworked, support for old rnc1-data
		format added, all decruncher a5/a6 save, optimized, less
		stack usage...
	- fix:	expansions memory (ws_ExpMem) is also aligned to $1000 if no
		MMU is available or MMU is unused by WHDLoad (Graham)
	- fix:	possible deadlock in the switch routine (OS<->Install)
		removed (Graham)
	- new:	information window on startup (while Preload/S) added, it
		shows infomations about the installed program, the Slave and
		the actual QuitKey, information about program and Slave are
		taken from an expanded Slave-structure (see include and
		autodoc	files), if a Slave with version prior 10 is used
		WHDLoad	displays only the name of the installed program which
		will be	build from the name of the Slave
		how long the information window is displayed can be changed
		with the new option SplashDelay/N
		(information window is inspirated by Mr.Larmer on 7.7.1998,
		nothing gets lost here :)
	- chg:	include file "whdload.i" splitted into "whdload.i" which
		contains WHDLoad base defines and "whdmacros.i" containing
		optional defines and macro definitions

***  9.2 (15.03.1999)

	- new:	WHDLTAG_TIME_GET to get actual date and time (Mr.Larmer)
	- fix:	problems with some 68030 systems fixed (WHDLoad uses some
		special hardware features in conjunction with the MMU
		related operations, some hardware does not support this
		(Apollo A630 and Magnum MK2 are known for this), on such
		systems you can't enable the MMU/S option - otherwise the
		machine will hang) (reported by Chris Thomas, Maxim Ilyn
		and Jess Sosnoski)

***  9.0 (17.01.1999)
	- chg:	performance of resload_LoadFileDecrunch improved
	- chg:	access fault handler for 68030 rewritten:

		   (ascending/descending mode, negative modulos, odd pointers
		   and odd modulos)
		 - a callback function can be setup (resload_Control) which
		   will called by WHDLoad if an Access Fault occurs, the
		   function can modify the bad access and decide if the
		   program should be continued or terminated, see autodoc for
		   further infos
	- fix:	potgo set to input mode now, fixes right mouse button problem
		with ArcherMcLeanPool and JimmyWhiteSnooker (Mr.Larmer)
	- new:	WHDLTAG_VERSION_GET, WHDLTAG_REVISION_GET, WHDLTAG_BUILD_GET
		for usage with resload_Control to get the major and minor
		version number and the build number of WHDLoad currently
		running, the build number is granted to be uniq and can be
		used to distinguish between different sub versions (Mr.Larmer)
	- new:	pressing Ctrl-Amiga-Amiga will cause WHDLoad to quit,
		depending on machine speed this may avoid cold reboots due a
		not restored execbase (Graham)
	- fix:	Snoop works again on 68060, was broken in 8.2
	- chg:	the vector table is not write protected if Snoop on a 68060 is
		enabled

***  8.2 (19.12.1998)
	- chg:	the vector table (VBR) is write protected now, to catch
		invalid to accesses to it (Mr.Larmer), requires that the MMU
		is used by WHDLoad, NoVBRMove is not set and no freezer is
		detected by WHDLoad in memory
	- fix:	problems with PAL and NTSC in conjunction with Picasso 96
		monitor drivers fixed (Tim Kovack)

	- new:	some changes and enhancements for HRTmon 2.25
	- fix:	Snoop works again for 68030 machines (was broken in v8.0)
	- chg:	all unsaved registers after executing a resload function
		(D0-D1/A0-A1 as far as they don't contain a return code)
		will be destroyed explicit now, for compatibility reasons

***  8.0 (22.11.1998) not public released!
	- chg:	if the write offset for a resload_SaveFileOffset operation
		lies outside the current length of the file and therefore
		the file must be enlarged before writing, WHDLoad tries now to
		fill this area with $ee, if there is not enough memory
		available for this, WHDLoad falls back to the old style by
		using dos.SetFileSize(), with the result that the enlarged
		area will contain random data
	- fix:	deadlock in switch routine fixed which occured when lightpen
		has been activated (e.g. "Die Hard 2")
	- fix:	cia's will be completly initialized by WHDLoad now, and also

		tested with all hunk types, see autodoc for more details
	- new:	function resload_Delay to wait a specified time or a button
		to be pressed (time independed from PAL/NTSC display)
	- new:	slave can request expansion memory (fast memory) now
		ATTENTION: slave structure has been enlarged
	- new:	TDREASON_MUSTREG (DarkAngel)
	- new:	WHDLTAG_IOERR_GET for usage with resload_Control to check if
		all names have been fitted in resload_ListFiles and to
		distinguish a file with a size of 0 from an nonexistent file
		in resload_GetFileSize (Harry)
	- new:	option D/S for debuging, if enabled the software freezer
		(Hrt/TK) will be activated at the first instruction of the
		Slave
	- new:	flag WHDLF_EmulLineA to emulate Line-A opcodes if the vbr is
		moved
	- new:	function resload_DeleteFile to delete files (Mr.Larmer)
	- new:	program SP which can save iff pictures from the new coredump
		files created by WHDLoad, works for most standard picture
		formats (Snoop* is required of course)
	- new:	sources for all programs except WHDLoad included, please note
		that most of them are copyrighted
	- chg:	many internal changes, also the problems with BloodMoney and
		CelticLegends seems to have been solved

		highest possible version number for a Slave, separate build
		number
	- new:	new tag for resload_Control to setup a function to restore
		destroyed custom registers during switch between OS and
		installed program (Harry)
	- chg:	functions resload_LoadFileOffset, resload_SaveFile and
		resload_SaveFileOffset can be used with a filesize of zero now
		(Harry)
	- chg:	the functions resload_Protect#? are checking now if the
		protected area matches the current SSP, if it does, WHDLoad
		will stop and show a requester "Unacceptible Arguments", this
		has been build in to reduce the likelihood of a Double Bus
		Fault, thanks to Mr.Larmer for reporting this problem
	- fix:	check of workbench arguments a bit more secure now
	- new:	new Slave flags WHDLF_Req68020 and WHDLF_ReqAGA, new
		TDREASON_REQ68020 and TDREASON_REQAGA, new tag
		WHDLTAG_CHIPREVBITS_GET for resload_Control, to handle
		programs which require a MC68020 or the AGA Chip Set (Mr.
		Larmer)
	- new:	TDREASON_MUSTNTSC and TDREASON_MUSTPAL to terminate if the
		installed program requires a specific display which isn't
		enabled (Mr.Larmer)
	- chg:	Preload/S now collects also files from sub directories
	- chg:	example sources (slaves/imager) reworked to assemble with
		Asm-Pro v1.12 (still some problems with labels in macros,
		but this is a problem of AsmPro)
	- new:	support for additional NewIcon in Install Templates
		(Mr.Larmer)

	the following problems are known and still unsolved:
	 - no exit possible from BloodMoney/CelticLegends
	 - Nitro does hang with Preload/S enabled, use WHDLoad v0.608 or
	   disable Preload/S to go around this

***  1.92 (08.06.1998)
	- fix:	problem with Clown'o'mania (©1989 Starbyte) does not work with
		WHDLoad v1.1 has been fixed, the reason was a different
		initialized ciaa.icr.tb	bit, to fix this and future problems
		WHDLoad does init the CIA interrupt mask explicit now, all
		interrupts are disabled	except the CIAA SP interrupt (used for
		keyboard) which is enabled. I have tried some installs and it
		seems to work ok, anyway it is possible that some installs may
		no longer work because they may expect that some interrupts
		are already enabled on startup - these installs must be fixed
		for this new WHDLoad
	- new:	TDREASON_OSEMUFAIL to support the OS emulation module
	- chg:	the message for instruction stream access faults has been
		corrected (Harry)
	- new:	option Expert/S, this option must be enabled to make core
		dumps using the DebugKey/K/N now, the option has been added to
		avoid that normal users press the wrong key by mistake (Harry)
	- new:	options ExecuteStartup and ExecuteCleanup to execute a command
		at start and at end of WHDLoad

***  1.1 (25.05.1998)
	- fix:	stack usage on resload_Decrunch and resload_LoadFileDecrunch
		decreased, speed of RNC1 decrunching improved a lot, its a
		really a good idea to patch the decrunch routine in games
		with resload_Decrunch if it uses RNC1 !
	- new:	DIC can create partial images now (option SIZE/K)
	- new:	WHDLoad performs now a "SetClock LOAD" at exit
	- fix:	some minor fixes in the gfx degrading routine
	- fix:	disk-dma check in os-switch modified, it switches dma off now
		instead of showing the white-color-cycle-bug-screen
		(because it's nowhere documented else: red - copper cannot
		switched off, blue - ints cannot switched off, green - blitter
		is busy but dma is off; after pressing LMB WHDLoad continues
		but it's undefined what will happen)
	- new:	new program "ITD" (ImageToDisk) to write disk images back to
		floppy or RAD: can format the disk, can write partial images,
		no verify, see documentation for more info
	- fix:	problems with second copperlist on reactivating os graphics
	- new:	blitter wait check if SnoopOCS/ECS/AGA enabled
	- new:	if available whdload will use reqtools.library instead
		intuitions requesters now, because they are screen centered
		and have better keyboard support
	- new:	with SnoopOCS/ECS/AGA all cpu used custom registers will be
		dumped now
	- chg:	tooltypes NTSC/PAL will now affect the display init routine
		(Intuition.OpenScreen()) therefore you need the appropriate
		monitor files installed
	- new:	functions resload_Protect#? to snoop memory accesses in
		various	ways, very useful for developer... (requested by
		Mr.Larmer)
	- new:	function resload_LoadFileOffset which is similar to
		resload_DiskLoad but for files
	- new:	flag WHDLF_NoDivZero for ws_Flags to prevent WHDLoad from exit
		if a "Division by Zero" exception occurs
	- chg:	all resload functions has been reworked to no longer modify
		registers a5 and a6, this solves problems with demos/games
		which expect that the contens of these registers are valid
		also in an interrupt, for example SWIV expects a5=global-data
		and a6=custom-base, the only exception from this rule are the
		functions resload_Decrunch and resload_LoadFileDecrunch when
		working on rnc packed files, in this case a5 is temporarly
		used (it is a bit hard to rewrite the whole decrunch
		routines and I'm low on time of course...)
		in general it is a good idea if the program you like to
		install does'nt work with WHDLoad to check the interrupt
		routines, if the interrupts make assuptions similar the above
		(e.g a4=anything) you have to disable the interrupts before
		calling any resload function and reenable after
	- chg:	WHDLoad checks now the current stackpointer each time the
		Slave calls a resload function, if the SP is lower than $180
		or outside the BaseMem area the program will be terminated and
		WHDLoad shows a requester about, this should avoid problems
		like destroyed vector tables or deadly double Access Faults
		in conjunction with an enabled Memory Protection
	- chg:	it is no longer required that SetPatch is executed before
		WHDLoad on 68040/68060 equipped machines because WHDLoad
		determinates the current CPU itself now
	- chg:	for 68060 only (68040 also??): the newer versions of
		68060.library (starting v41.1) does remap the memory $0-$1000
		(the first page) to a fast mem location using the MMU, this
		will make major problems if the	option NoMMU is activated: in
		this case WHDLoad will not change any MMU related registers
		and this address translation will remain intact !!!
		if the installed program tries to use this area for any dma
		actions (e.g. a copperlist in this area) the results will be
		unforeseeable, because the cpu will read/write the fast-mem
		location and dma's the real chip-mem which contains random
		data !!!
		I don't want to disable the NoMMU option for 68040/060
		machines, therefore the following has been changed: the
		longword at address $1000 does now contain the value -2 which
		is the copper instruction cend (was on address $300 in earlier
		WHDLoad versions), the minimum BaseMemSize has been increased
		to $2000. If NoMMU is selected and the above mentioned
		address translation is active an requester will inform the
		user about the existing problem.
	- new:	options ButtonWait/S and Custom1/K/N ... Custom5/K/N for
		slave specific things (requested by Harry)
	- chg:	WriteDelay/K/N does also affect the FileLog/S feature now,
		this means that after each write to the logfile WHDLoad will
		wait the time specified via WriteDelay/K/N to minimize the
		danger of filesystem corupption
	- chg:	install scripts has been reworked, PLEASE check them !
	- chg:	sources has been changed and new added, PLEASE check them !
	- chg:	WHDLoad is shareware now, read documention for more info
