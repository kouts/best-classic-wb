    NAME
        wbdockapp_gc -- custom dock app for wbdock2

    SUPERCLASS
        frbuttonclass

    REQUIRES
        

    DESCRIPTION
        This document describes which tags and methods should be implemented
        for a dock app to work properly with wbdock2. Everything here is
        optional if you forward unknown methods and tags to the super class.

     METHODS
        OM_NEW -- Create an object to be displayed in the wbdock dock bar.

        OM_SET -- Set various attributes. See below.

        OM_GET -- Retrieve attributes. See below.

        OM_UPDATE -- Same as OM_SET

        OM_NOTIFY -- Not used.

        OM_DISPOSE -- Free the dock object. This does not mean that you
                      are done. It also happens if the dock bar is
                      closed and re-opened for a prefs change.

        GM_RENDER -- Render the dock object. Forward this to the super class
                     to render the background and frame. After that you can
                     draw your specific contents.

        GM_HITTEST -- Checks if the dock was hit by the mouse pointer.
                      It is used by wbdock for various purposes, not
                      only for mouse clicks.

        GM_GOACTIVE -- The object was clicked by the mouse.

        GM_HANDLEINPUT -- Processes input while the mouse button is pressed.

        GM_GOINACTIVE -- The mouse button was released.

        GM_LAYOUT -- May be used to calculate positions.
                     Note: when called from wbdock, the GadgetInfo is faked.
                     Only the gi_Screen pointer is valid.

        WBDOCK_TICK -- This method is called 50 times per second. You can use
                       it to animate your icon or to handle input from a
                       window you opened or something similar.
                       Make sure to be quick.

        WBDOCK_DROPICON -- An icon has been dropped on your dock object.



     ATTRIBUTES

        WBDOCK_MinWidth (ULONG)
            Query the minimum width of your object before the window is
            opened.

            Applicability is (OM_GET)

        WBDOCK_MinHeight (ULONG)
            Query the minimum height of your object before the window is
            opened.

            Applicability is (OM_GET)

        WBDOCK_Screen (struct Screen *)
            Set the screen on which the dock will open. Use this to allocate
            screen-related resources (pens, datatypes) before the window
            opens. Be prepared to receive a NULL pointer in which case you
            should free all resources you previously allocated.

            Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

        WBDOCK_HitBox (struct IBox)
            Query the box where your object can be hit. This box is used to
            define the AppWindow drop zone for Workbench. That is the zone
            where an icon can be dropped on your object.
            Note: unlike other attributes here the opg_Storage pointer does
            not point to a 4-byte ULONG but to the 8-byte struct IBox.
            WBDock pre-fills the box with your LeftEdge / TopEdge / Width
            and Height, so normally you do not need to support this tag. The
            AmiDock style uses this to exclude the textual label from the
            drop box.

            Applicability is (OM_GET)

        WBDOCK_HelpText (CONST_STRPTR)
            When the mouse pointer hovers over the dock bar, wbdock might show
            some hint text. If this happens, your object is queried for the
            text to display. The pointer is pre-filled with the file name of
            your class.
            Note: if you change the pointer, you must supply a valid string
            pointer. Do not return NULL or an invalid pointer!

            Applicability is (OM_GET)
