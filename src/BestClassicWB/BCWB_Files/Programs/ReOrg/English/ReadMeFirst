   The `Installer' utility ((C) by Commodore) is included in this
distribution and will install ReOrg on your harddisk automatically.
There are installation scripts for different languages in the `Install'
directory of the original disk.

   Unfortunately, due to licensing restrictions I cannot include a
localized version of the `Installer' utility on this disk.  This means
all Installer-specific texts during the installation process are always
in English, no matter which language you started the installation
program in.

   If you have a localized version of the `Installer' utility, you can
use that to install ReOrg:
   * Install the localized `Installer' program somewhere in your path
     on your harddisk.

   * Select the ReOrg installation icon (e.g. `Install' in the
     `English' drawer) and use the Workbench menu item
     `Icons/Information' to change the "Default Tool" to `Installer'
     (remove the `/' at the beginning of `/Installer').

   If you do not have a harddisk, you can make a copy of the original
disk and run ReOrg directly from that disk.

   The online help feature requires `amigaguide.library' to be
installed in your `libs:' directory. Usually the installation program
will take care of this. However if you run ReOrg directly from the
original disk without installing it first, make sure you have
`amigaguide.library' installed, or you will not be able to use the
online help feature.
