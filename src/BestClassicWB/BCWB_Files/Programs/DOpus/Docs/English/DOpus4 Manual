@{b}Introduction@{ub}@{PAR}

Welcome to the Directory Opus 4 Manual!@{PAR}

DirectoryOpus 4 (or 'Diropus', or 'DOpus') is a legendary file manager for Amiga Computers. It
features two directory windows, a very intuitive graphical user interface (including Drag'n
drop functionality) and is probably one of the most configurable programs you'll ever come
across.@{PAR}

It was developed by Jonathan Potter, the first (commercial) version was released in 1990.
Development continued until 1994 (up to version number 4.12), when Jonathan joined GPSoftware
as a partner, due to disputes with his former distributor about the non-payment of outstanding
royalties.@{PAR}

Together, they rewrote the program from scratch, turning it into a complete Workbench
replacement. That 'new' DirOpus (called DirOpus5, later versions are entitled 'Magellan' or
'Magellan 2') is still available for the Amiga from GPSoftware and most Amiga dealers, but the
decline of the Amiga market has forced the development of the Amiga version to be put on
indefinite hold.@{PAR}

Jon Potter and Greg Perry of GPSoftware are still developing Directory Opus. Currently a
Windows 95/98/NT version is nearing completion. This builds on the concepts of DOpus4 and
DOpus5 and introduces a number of new features and design elements for the PC market.@{PAR}

The 'old' DirOpus4 was released on several magazine coverdisks, but it retained its copyrighted
status until 1999. At that time, GPSoftware decided that the program had lost all its commercial
value, and they released the source codes under the GNU Public License.@{PAR}

At that point, Jacek Rzeuski took over the development of DirOpus. New versions of the program
can always be found on Aminet or at the @{" homepage " link contact} of the Directory Opus Research Project.@{PAR}

This manual was spread with coverdisk versions of Directory Opus 4. It's now the official
manual for Directory Opus 4, as the original printed manual is far more difficult to
distribute :)@{PAR}

@NODE reqments "Directory Opus 4 System Requirements"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Minimum System requirements@{ub}@{PAR}

To get Directory Opus 4 running you should have an Amiga computer with
at least AmigaOS 3.0. This computer should be equipped with a 68020
processor (or any later model of the 68xxx CPU series). DirOpus needs at
least 0.5 megabyte of memory.@{PAR}

@{FG Highlight}Recommended Third Party AddOns@{FG text}@{PAR}

Additional functionality can be achieved by installing the third party
libraries described below.@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

@{i}PopupMenu.library: @{ui}@{PAR}

This will enable the popup menu that appears by clicking on the
@{" Disk Name " link 1.5.2} field with the right mouse button. This library is
Freeware and can be found on Aminet (util/libs/pmuser.lha).@{PAR}

@{i}XADMaster.library: @{ui}@{PAR}

This is a depacker system that is used to handle various types of file archives from
within DOpus. With this library system installed, you can @{" browse through archives " link 1.11} as
if it were normal directories. This library is Shareware and can be found on Aminet
(util/arc/xadmaster.lha). It is also included with OS 3.9 (OS 3.9 users: Please read
the @{" FAQ " link faq} entry regarding XADmaster.library!!). See also: @{" FORCEOPENXAD " link 1.3.1} tooltype.@{PAR}

@{i}XFDMaster.library: @{ui}@{PAR}

This is a decruncher system that decompresses crunched files on
the fly. DirOpus utilizes this library to load such crunched files
(i.e. into the text viewer). This library is Freeware and can be
found on Aminet (util/pack/xfdmaster.lha). See also: @{" FORCEOPENXFD " link 1.3.1}
tooltype and @{" -x " link 1.3.2} argument.@{PAR}

@{i}SysInfo.library: @{ui}@{PAR}

DirOpus can use this library for CPU usage estimation (instead of internal
meter). This might result in a more accurate value. Note that the library requires
Executive or SysMon to work. If none of them is running DOpus falls back to
internal meter. SysInfo.library support must be turned on with the @{" USESYSINFO " link 1.3.1} tooltype.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE installation "Installation"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Installing Directory Opus@{ub}@{PAR}

To install DirectoryOpus, just copy its directory to any place on your harddisk.@{PAR}

The program doesn't require any additional libraries to work, but there are several
recommended third party Add-Ons that will increase DOpus' functionality. Have a look at
the @{" Requirements " link reqments} section for more information.@{PAR}

Beginning with version 4.16, Directory Opus does not need an assign anymore.
If you are upgrading from earlier versions of the program, check your
"User-Startup" file located in S: and remove the following line:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

ASSIGN DOPUS: <path to your old version of DOpus>@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

(where "<path to...>" would be something like "SYS:Tools/Dopus").@{PAR}

@{FG highlight}Further notes regarding installation@{FG text}@{PAR}

If you're upgrading from a very old version (3.x or earlier) or you used to
have your DirOpus files spread around your harddisk, please make sure that

@NODE 1.1 "DOWT/What is Directory Opus ?"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}1.1 - What Is Directory Opus?@{ub}@{PAR}

The theory behind Directory Opus is quite simple. On the screen there
are two windows. These are called Directory Windows. You can read a
directory into each of these from any device accessible by the Amiga.@{PAR}

You select files and/or directories in either of these windows, then
manipulate them almost any way you like. Selected entries can be copied
to the opposite window, deleted or renamed; text files can be read,
picture files can be viewed, and sound files can be heard.@{PAR}

Directory Opus offers much more than these "bare-bones" features, and you will
learn more throughout this guide.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 1.2 "DOWT/Files and Directories"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}1.2 - Files and Directories@{ub}@{PAR}

The Amiga's DOS (Disk Operating System) deals with two kinds of data
arrangement: files and directories.@{PAR}

Each file and directory must be given a unique name; within a directory
you cannot have two files, two directories, or a file and a directory
with the same name as each other.@{PAR}

@{FG Highlight}Files@{FG text}@{PAR}

Any data you record on a disk is stored in a file. Files contain
information, which may be from a database, from a word processor,
from a paint program, or the entire contents of a program.@{PAR}

The size of a file is expressed in bytes, each byte being
equivalent to one character. Storing the string "Hello" in a file
would use five bytes, as the word "Hello" is five characters long.@{PAR}

Whether a file can be displayed, executed, deleted, edited or
considered as a script file depends upon attributes that are
explained in the @{" Protection " link 2.1} Requester section.@{PAR}

All files have a datestamp which shows what the system date and
time were the last time the file was written to.@{PAR}

Files may also have a comment of up to 79 characters attached
to them. @{PAR}

@{FG Highlight}Directories@{FG text}@{PAR}

To store information in a logical manner, disks are generally
organised into directories, which are often referred to as
as drawers. If you picture a disk as a filing cabinet, with your
programs, database files and pictures as the actual files, than
directories are the drawers of the filing cabinet. Some of these
drawers have further drawers inside them, called sub-directories,
which themselves contain drawers, and so on, indefinitely.@{PAR}

The directory or sub-directory containing any given sub-directory
is known as its parent directory.@{PAR}

The highest level of organisation is the Root Directory. If the
directory is a filing cabinet, then the root directory is the room
it stands in.@{PAR}

The route you take along a directory tree to reach a file is
called path. As you proceed along the path, each branch of the
tree is separated from the next by a / character. For example,
the path of Archives is expressed as Work:Downloads/Archives.@{PAR}

To refer to Picture.ARC, you use what is called pathname. This
consists of a file's path, followed by the name of the file,
Picture.ARC's pathname would be:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 3}

Work:Downloads/Archives/Picture.ARC@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

The number of files and sub-directories any given directory can
contain is limited only by the amount of space on the disk.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 1.3 "DOWT/Running Directory Opus"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}1.3 - Running Directory Opus@{ub}@{PAR}

There are three common ways of running Directory Opus.@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

@{" Manually from Workbench             " link 1.3.1}@{PAR}
@{" Manually from CLI                   " link 1.3.2}@{PAR}
@{" Automatically from the User-Startup " link 1.3.3}@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 1.3.1 "DOWT/Running Directory Opus"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}1.3.1 - Starting From Workbench@{ub}@{PAR}

The easiest way to run Directory Opus is from the Workbench. Double
click on the Directory Opus icon on the Workbench screen and a few
seconds later the Directory Opus screen will appear.@{PAR}

You may also specify a directory that should be read into DOpus' left directory
lister at startup, overriding the configuration settings. Just select the directory
you want to display in DOpus, hold "Shift" and double-click on DOpus' icon.@{PAR}

If you've got the @{" XAD libraries " link reqments} installed, you may even specify an archive
that DOpus should display in its left directory lister. Again, just select the
archive file, hold "Shift" and double-click DOpus' icon.@{PAR}

@{FG Highlight}ToolTypes@{FG text}@{PAR}

If started from Workbench, DirOpus understands the following Tooltypes
(have a look at your Amiga documentation, if you do not understand the
concept of tooltypes):@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

@{i}ICONSTART=1 @{ui}@{PAR}

Tells Directory Opus to start up iconified, which means that
the program will open only a small window on the Workbench
screen, instead of its own custom screen, and will sit
unobtrusively in the background until needed.@{PAR}

@{i}BUTTONSTART=1 @{ui}@{PAR}

Tells Directory Opus to start up @{" Button Iconified " link 1.9.1.Button_Iconified}. This is
a special variation of iconification: Only the Button Banks
will be shown on the Workbench screen. If both ICONSTART=1
and BUTTONSTART=1 are specified, Directory Opus will start up
Button Iconified.@{PAR}

@{i}CHECK=0 @{ui}@{PAR}

Directory Opus can be run several times at once. Normally
the program will check at Startup, if another copy is already
running. In case Directory Opus is already running, you will
be asked, if you want to run another copy, bring the already
running DirOpus to front or cancel the whole process. With
this ToolType, you can deactivate this check. Just set CHECK=0.@{PAR}

@{i}CONFIGFILE=<path to configfile> @{ui}@{PAR}

Tells Directory Opus where to load the configuration file
from. For instance, CONFIGFILE=DH1:stuff/directoryopus.cfg
would load (and subsequently save) the configuration file
from DH1:stuff/directoryopus.cfg. By default, DirOpus will
look in DOpus:S/ or S: for its configuration settings.@{PAR}

@{i}FORCEOPENXAD @{ui}@{PAR}

This will force DirOpus to open the XADMaster library at
startup (this library is used for handling archives). Normally
Directory Opus opens that library only when needed, and only if
it is opened by another program already.@{PAR}

@{i}FORCEOPENXFD @{ui}@{PAR}

This will force DirOpus to open the XFDMaster library at
startup (this library is used for reading crunched files into
the text reader or for printing them). Normally Directory
Opus opens that library only when needed, and only if it is
opened by another program already.@{PAR}

@{i}USESYSINFO @{ui}@{PAR}

This enables @{" sysinfo.library " link reqments} support.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 1.3.2 "DOWT/Running Directory Opus"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}1.3.2 - Starting From a CLI@{ub}@{PAR}

To run Directory Opus from the CLI enter:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

CD <path of DOpus' directory>@{PAR}
DirectoryOpus@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

The first line switches to Directory Opus' directory, the second line start DirOpus.@{PAR}

You may also specify a directory that should be read into DOpus' left directory
lister at startup, overriding the configuration settings. Here's an example (assuming
DOpus can be found in "SYS:Tools/DirOpus"):@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

CD SYS:Tools/DirOpus/@{PAR}
DirectoryOpus Work:download/@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

If you've got the @{" XAD libraries " link reqments} installed, you may even specify an archive
that DOpus should display in its left directory lister:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

CD SYS:Tools/DirOpus/@{PAR}
DirectoryOpus Work:download/archive.lha@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

@{FG Highlight}Arguments@{FG text}@{PAR}

DirOpus understands several arguments when it is started from the CLI
(NOTE: These arguments are case sensitive!):@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

@{i}-i @{ui}@{PAR}

Tells Directory Opus to start up iconified, which means
that the program will open only a small window on the
Workbench screen, instead of its own custom screen, and
will sit unobtrusively in the background until needed.@{PAR}

@{i}-b @{ui}@{PAR}

Tells Directory Opus to start up @{" Button Iconified " link 1.9.1.Button_Iconified}.
This is a special variation of iconification: Only the
Button Banks will be shown on the Workbench screen. If
both -i and -b are specified, Directory Opus will start
up Button Iconified.@{PAR}

@{i}-g @{ui}@{PAR}

Directory Opus can be run several times at once. Normally
the program will check at Startup, if another copy is
already running. In case Directory Opus is already
running, you will be asked, if you want to run another
copy, bring the already running DirOpus to front or cancel
the whole process. Specifying this argument will
deactivate this check.@{PAR}

@{i}-c @{ui}@{PAR}

Tells Directory Opus where to load the configuration file
from. For instance, -cDH1:stuff/directoryopus.cfg would
load (and subsequently save) the configuration file from
DH1:stuff/directoryopus.cfg. By default, it will look in
DOpus:S/ and S:@{PAR}

@{i}-X @{ui}@{PAR}

This will force DirOpus to open the XADMaster library at
startup (this library is used for handling archives). Normally
Directory Opus opens that library only when needed, and only if
it is opened by another program already.@{PAR}

@{i}-x @{ui}@{PAR}

This will force DirOpus to open the XFDMaster library at
startup (this library is used for reading crunched files
into the text reader or for printing them). Normally
Directory Opus opens that library only when needed, and
only if it is opened by another program already.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 1.3.3 "DOWT/Running Directory Opus"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}1.3.3 - Automatic Startup in the User-Startup@{ub}@{PAR}

The User-Startup is a script file that is automatically executed when
you first turn on the computer. It can contain instructions to do many
different things, including running Directory Opus.@{PAR}

To modify your User-Startup you need a text
editor such as Commodore's Ed or MEmax. A highly recommended commercial
text editor is CygnusEd Professional, by ASDG-Inc. This is the text
editor with which Directory Opus was written, and is a very powerful
tool.@{PAR}

Run your text editor and load your User-Startup into it. The
User-Startup resides in the S: directory of your boot disk. Pick a
convenient place to put the new instruction (you can really put it
anywhere) and add the following lines:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

;BEGIN DirOpus@{PAR}
CD SYS:Tools/DirOpus@{PAR}
DirectoryOpus -i@{PAR}
;END DirOpus@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

This assumes you have installed DirectoryOpus in a directory called
"SYS:Tools/DirOpus/". Of course you need to use the actual directory path.@{PAR}

The -i at the end of the instruction tells Directory Opus to start up
iconified, which means that the program will open only a small window
on the Workbench screen, instead of its own custom screen, and will sit
unobtrusively in the background until needed. If you do not want
Directory Opus to start up iconified, simply remove the -i.@{PAR}

Have a look at the @{" Running DirOpus from CLI " link 1.3.2} section for more
arguments that can be added to the instruction.@{PAR}

The more technically inclined may notice that there is no RUN on the
instruction line. This is because Directory Opus detaches itself,
freeing up the CLI and allowing it to continue with the User-Startup
(and ultimately closing).@{PAR}

Make sure you save the User-Startup once you have modified it. If your
changes make sense, Directory Opus will be run automatically when you
boot up.@{PAR}

@{FG Highlight}Aborting@{FG text}@{PAR}

Before using the program, it is important to know how to abort an
action. Most commands can be aborted once they have begun, and
this can be useful if you accidentally start deleting the contents
of your hard drive.@{PAR}

To abort, press the left and right mouse buttons simultaneously.
This will only take effect if the Directory Opus screen is active
(i.e., at the front of the display).@{PAR}

Do not be alarmed if the action does not abort immediately; some
commands such as copy have to finish the file they are working on
before aborting.@{PAR}

There are two Directory windows. Only one window is active at a time.
Because some actions, such as copy, work with selected files in the
active Directory Window and use the inactive Directory Window as the
destination, the active window is referred to as the Source Window and
the inactive window is referred to as the Destination Window.@{PAR}

@{FG Highlight}Selecting the Active Directory Window@{FG text}@{PAR}

Clicking anywhere in a window with either mouse button will
activate that window. Unless you are extremely precise in your
placement of the pointer, however, clicking with the left mouse
button to activate a window may lead to selecting an
unwanted entry. This is when using the right mouse button can be
useful, as selecting entries is a left mouse button command, but
clicking with the right mouse button will never have that effect.@{PAR}

Pressing the space bar or the TAB key activates the inactive
directory window. This allows you to toggle between the active and
inactive windows.@{PAR}

@{FG highlight}The PopUp Menu@{FG text}@{PAR}

Clicking on the Disk Name with the right mouse button (and holding that

@{b}Entering Sub-Directories@{ub}@{PAR}

Many directories that you read in will contain sub-directories. Instead
of having to type in the name of a sub-directory, you only need to
double-click on it. This will load the sub-directory into the same
Directory Window.@{PAR}

Opening the sub-directory in the other directory window allows you to
copy files between the sub-directory and its parent. To do this, you
perform a @{" Click-M-Click " link glos} operation (Click Move Click) with the left mouse button.
Click-M-Click means to click first on a sub-directory entry then to
move the mouse pointer to the other (inactive) window and click again.
This can be tricky because the two clicks must occur within the Amiga
Configured Double-Click Time (see Amiga Input Preferences).@{PAR}

An alternative method to Click-M-Click (which requires less mouse
pointer gymnastics), is called @{" Click-Drag-Release " link glos}:
Click and hold on an unselected sub-directory entry. Then, without releasing the
left mouse button, press and release the right mouse button. Still holding the left mouse
button, move the mouse pointer to the inactive window. As you move the
mouse pointer, a copy of the selected sub-directory will follow the
mouse. When you position the mouse pointer over the inactive window,
release the mouse button; the sub-directory will be read into the
inactive window, which now will become the active Directory Window.@{PAR}

A final alternative (also called @{" Click-Drag-Release " link glos}), is
to click and hold on an unselected sub-directory entry. Then, without
releasing the left mouse button, move the pointer to the unselected
Directory Window. The trick to this method is to move the mouse
pointer horizontally without moving up or down (this is for the sure
handed mouse gymnast). Should you inadvertently move the mouse pointer
over an entry above or below the selected sub-directory, that entry
will follow the mouse pointer over to the inactive window and will be
read when you release the mouse pointer.@{PAR}

If the directory displayed in a Directory Window is a sub-directory,
you may wish to return to its Parent Directory. You could return to the
Parent directory by editing the Directory Field text directly, but the
procedure is cumbersome and error-prone; there are better ways.@{PAR}

The default configuration includes a Custom Button which returns you to
the @{" Parent " link 1.6.Parent} Directory.@{PAR}

Each Directory Window contains a hidden Parent button on the outer edge
of the window area which will move you to a Parent Directory. On the

On the right Directory window, it is the black border on the far right.
When you click the left mouse button on a hidden Parent button,
Directory Opus will display the directory's parent, if it has one. When
you click the right mouse button on the hidden Parent button, Directory
Opus will display the root directory.@{PAR}

Double clicking on a window's @{" Disk Name " link 1.5.2} field with the left

Once a directory had been read in, it is displayed in the directory
window. There is limited space in the window so the entire directory
contents may not be visible at once. A pair of Sliders extends your
view of the window. In the center of the two directory windows are two
vertical Window Sliders. You can slide these up and down thus scroll
though the contents of the directory.@{PAR}

To slide the vertical window view sliders, press the left mouse button
on the black bar and, while holding down the mouse button, move the
mouse up and down.@{PAR}

Click above or below the solid bar for the slider to move one page in
that direction.@{PAR}

At the bottom of the two vertical Window View Sliders are arrow
buttons. These will move the slider on their line in the direction of
the arrow when clicked on.@{PAR}

Click and hold the left mouse button on one of the arrow buttons for
the directory to continuously scroll through the window.@{PAR}

Press either the up or down cursor keys to move one line in that
direction. These too will continuously scroll when held down.@{PAR}

Press the up or down cursor keys in conjunction with either SHIFT key
to move a page in that direction.@{PAR}

Press the cursor key in conjunction with the CTRL key to jump to the
top or bottom of the directory listing.@{PAR}

To scroll quickly to the first entry starting with a particular letter,
press that letter. The directory will scroll as close as it can get
to the first entry, file or directory, starting with that letter.@{PAR}

Press a letter in conjunction with either SHIFT key to scroll only to
the first file beginning with that letter.@{PAR}

Regardless of if entire directory fits in vertically, it will
definitely not fit in horizontally. There is more information available
for entries than just the filename. Also displayed is the size in
bytes, the @{" protection " link 2.1} bits assigned to that entry, the date that
entry was last written to the disk, and any @{" comment " link 1.6.Comment} that may be
assigned to that entry.@{PAR}

Horizontal Window View Sliders can be seen at the bottom of the
directory windows, with arrows at the inner ends. These work like the
Vertical Window Views Sliders, including the keyboard equivalents.@{PAR}

You can also scroll up and down, and left and right, by holding the
right mouse button and moving the mouse.@{PAR}

The Directory Windows are usually tha same size. If you want to see
more information than is displayed in the windows you can stretch the
divider between them left or right to resize them.@{PAR}

There is a hidden size bar between the two vertical Window View
Sliders. When you click and hold this button, the size bar will appear.
While holding he mouse button, move the mouse left or right. When you

string fields instead of one. You will usually just edit the name in
the lower of the two fields to the new name.@{PAR}

A limited type of @{" wildcard " link WldCrdPat} rename is possible. Entering an * in the
bottom field allows you to add prefixes or suffixes. For instance,
entering *.pic will add a .pic suffix to all selected entries. Entering
A* will add an A prefix. Only one * may be used in this process.@{PAR}

You cannot give a file a name that contains an *.@{PAR}

If you enter a * in the top as well as the bottom field, you can
replace sections of the name. For example, entering *.pic in the top
Field and *.iff in the bottom Field will replace the .pic suffix in
that entry that has one with a .iff suffix. If an entry does not have
a .pic suffix, it will be left untouched. The * may also be embedded.

This command closes the Directory Opus window and screen, deallocates
as much memory as possible, and then opens a small window on the
Workbench screen. This is known as iconifying, and allows you to have
Directory Opus constantly available, while using the least amount of
memory.@{PAR}

The iconified window may contain a clock, or may not be visible at all,
depending on how you have set the Iconified type @{" configuration " link 3.19.2} option.@{PAR}

To determine the initial position of the iconified window (especially
if you plan to start up Directory Opus in the iconified state), you
should iconify Directory Opus, and position the window as you would
like it to appear. That done, re-enter Directory Opus, and save the
@{" configuration " link 3.3 30}.@{PAR}

When iconified, you can drop Workbench Icons on the Directory Opus
window. This will have the same effect as if you displayed the file in
a Directory Opus window and double-click on it. For Example, if you
drop a picture on the window, it will show it.@{PAR}

To re-enter Directory Opus, click the left mouse button in the
iconified window, then press the right mouse button. If you wish to
quit Directory Opus without going back into it, click the close button
at the top left of the iconified window.@{PAR}

Note that if you have the configuration option Iconify Type set to
Hidden, the only way to re-enter Directory Opus is with the hotkeys.

where to copy it. You can also use the bank of buttons as an AppWindow:
To show a picture, you would simply @{" drag'n drop " link 1.10} the icon of
the picture onto the show button.@{PAR}

The slider to the right of the button bank allows you choose which

@NODE 1.11 "DOWT/Handling archives"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}1.11 - Handling archives with Directory Opus@{ub}@{PAR}

A file (or disk) archive is a group of files concatenated to one single file, usually crunched
afterwards to reduce filesize. Archives are very handy for transfering files through
networks or bulletin board systems. Most files you will come across these days are distributed
in archive format. Most common archive formats are "LhA", "LZX", "ZIP" and "GZIP"
(to name but a few).@{PAR}

To deal with file archives (i.e. examine their contents, extract them (or parts of them)), you
would normally have to use a seperate dearchiving tool for each archive type you come across,
learn its commandline syntax or configure your software to make use of it. Additionally, if
you just need one single file from an archive (or just want to have a quick look at the
archive's contents) you would always have to extract the whole archive.@{PAR}

But if you've got the @{" XAD library system " link reqments} installed, Directory Opus is able
to handle more than 60 archive formats internally. You can browse through archives as if it were
normal directories! You can enter subdirectories within an archive, extract one or more files
(simply by selecting them and hitting the "Copy" button) or access files (i.e. load them into
the text reader) without extracting them!@{PAR}

set. Start Directory Opus by doubleclicking its icon on the Workbench screen
(or use the @{" -X " link 1.3.2} commandline switch if you're starting DOpus from the CLI).@{PAR}

Now you have to modify your existing filetypes. Go to the Configuration program, enter the
@{" filetype " link 3.9.1} section and delete the "double-click action" of all your archive
filetypes. If this action is undefined, DOpus will start @{" browsing an archive " link 1.11.browse} if you
doubleclick it.@{PAR}

before continuing!@{PAR}

To "enter" an archive, simply double-click it.@{PAR}

Now you're "inside" the archive. You can enter sub-directories by double-clicking them. You can
select or deselect files and directories as usual.@{PAR}

Additionally, you can use the following buttons:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}


@{i}Parent @{ui}@{PAR}

This will display the parent directory. If the archive's root directory is displayed
when clicking the "Parent" button, you'll leave the archive (the directory containing
the archive will be displayed again).@{PAR}

@{i}Root @{ui}@{PAR}

This will display the archive's "root" directory. Clicking the "Root" button while the
archive's root directory is displayed already will leave the archive.@{PAR}

@{i}Copy, CopyAs @{ui}@{PAR}

These buttons will extract the selected files from the archive.@{PAR}

NOTE: You can't ADD files to an archive using these buttons. The XAD library system
does not support modifying archives (The Move(As) command does not work for the same
reason). You'll still need to use external tools for creating archives, or adding files
to archives.@{PAR}

@{i}Getsizes, Hunt @{ui}@{PAR}

These buttons will work the same way as with normal directories. In other words: you can
"Hunt" files inside an archive or even calculate directory sizes without extracting it!@{PAR}

@NODE 2.1 "Req&View/Protection Requester"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}2.1 Protection Requester@{ub}@{PAR}

The Protection Requester allows you to change a file's or sub-
directory's protection bits.@{PAR}

The protection bits are a group of flags that are stored with the file,
that determine the characteristics of the file. These flags are given
one character names. The protection bits currently in use are:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

@{" H " link 2.1.bits} Hidden@{PAR}
@{" S " link 2.1.bits} Script@{PAR}
@{" P " link 2.1.bits} Pure@{PAR}
@{" A " link 2.1.bits} Archived@{PAR}
@{" R " link 2.1.bits} Readable@{PAR}
@{" W " link 2.1.bits} Writeable@{PAR}
@{" E " link 2.1.bits} Executable@{PAR}
@{" D " link 2.1.bits} Deleteable@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

While AmigaDOS and other programs do not fully support all of these
bits, DirectoryOpus gives you access to all documented protection bits.
As AmigaDOS is enhanced, some bits, such as Writeable, will become more
useful. If you have additional questions about the usage of the bits,
refer to your Amiga Documentation.@{PAR}

There is a button for each protection bit along the left edge of the
requester. Clicking on each of these will toggle a checkmark on and
off within the button. When the checkmark is on, it means that the bit
will be set when you click the Okay button.@{PAR}

In the middle of the requester are four buttons which manipulate
multiple protection bits at a time. These buttons do not cause any
action to take place within the selected files, they simply change the
state of the protection bit buttons.@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

@{" All bits " link 2.1.buttons}@{PAR}
@{" None     " link 2.1.buttons}@{PAR}
@{" Toggle   " link 2.1.buttons}@{PAR}
@{" Revert   " link 2.1.buttons}@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

On the right side of the requester are three groups of protection bits:
@{" Old " link 2.1.buttons}, @{" New " link 2.1.buttons}, and @{" Mask " link 2.1.buttons}. Each group contains a protection bit
letter or a '-' (dash) for each bit. The letter indicates that the
associated protection bit is set, a dash indicates that it is clear.@{PAR}

Along the bottom of the requester are three buttons:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

@{i}Okay @{ui}@{PAR}

Causes the current file (shown in the screen title bar) to be set
set as indicated in the protection bit buttons (and possibly
filtered according to the Mask Group).@{PAR}

@{i}All @{ui}@{PAR}

Causes all selected files to be set, without additional prompting,
as indicated in the protection bit buttons (and possibly filtered
according to the @{" Mask " link 2.1.buttons} Group).@{PAR}

@{i}Cancel @{ui}@{PAR}

Aborts the Protection command.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 2.1.BITS "Req&View/Protection Requester"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{i}H - Hidden @{ui}@{PAR}

If this flag is set, the file is not normally displayed. This
allows you to mark certain files as "invisible", to avoid
cluttering your directories. The file can still be accessed
normally, and not all programs implement this flag.@{PAR}

@{i}S - Script @{ui}@{PAR}

A script file is a file containing a list of AmigaDOS commands
to execute; it is like a simple computer program. This flag
indicates that the file in question is a script file. A script
file is sometimes called a batch file.@{PAR}

@{i}P - Pure @{ui}@{PAR}

If a program file is flagged as pure, it can be made to remain in
memory, even when not in use, This can save a great deal of time,
especially if the program is used a lot, as it does not have to
be loaded from disk each time.@{PAR}

@{i}A - Archive @{ui}@{PAR}

This flag indicted that the file has not been changed. If this
file is ever written to, the A flag will be turned off. This can
be used in a hard disk backup program, to record which files have
been backed-up, and need not be backed-up again.@{PAR}

@{i}R - Readable @{ui}@{PAR}

If this flag is set, the file can be accessed.@{PAR}

@{i}W - Writeable @{ui}@{PAR}

If this flag is set, the file can be written to (ie, more
information can be stored in it than is already there).@{PAR}

@{i}E - Executable @{ui}@{PAR}

If a program file does not have this flag set, it can not be run.@{PAR}

@{i}D - Deleteable @{ui}@{PAR}

protection bit buttons.@{PAR}

@{i}Revert @{ui}@{PAR}

you entered this requester.@{PAR}

@{i}Old @{ui}@{PAR}

The Old group indicates the original bits when you entered the
requester.@{PAR}

@{i}New @{ui}@{PAR}

The New indicates the current status of the protection bit
buttons. Whenever you click the protection bit button, it will
be reflected in the New group.@{PAR}

@{i}Mask @{ui}@{PAR}

Unlike the previously described Old and New groups, the Mask group
bits can be changed by clicking on the associated letter or dash.
The Mask group allows you to specify protection bits which should
not be modified, regardless of the protection bit buttons. 
When the Letter is shown, the bit will not be modified. The dash
means that you need to set the bit according to the setting of
the protection bit button. This is most useful when changing
files within a sub-directory or using the All button. For
example: you want to set the Archive bit in all files contained
in a sub-directory, but you don't want to affect any of the other
protection bits. Set the Archive Protection button on the left
side of the requester and set all the Archive bits in the Mask
group except A. This will preserve all the file's bits with the
exception of the Archive bit, which will be set.@{PAR}

There are keyboard shortcuts available to (un)set bits in the "Mask" group: Just
press "Shift" and the first letter of the bits' name (i.e. "Shift+A").@{PAR}

It was never meant to be used on hard disks, it is more a nuisance than
a benefit on such devices.@{PAR}

@{i}Put Trashcan @{ui}@{PAR}

This button allows you to put a trashcan in the root directory
of the newly formatted device.@{PAR}

@{i}Verify @{ui}@{PAR}

This button allows you to disable the format verification. As with
@{" Disk Copy " link 2.2}, the process is faster with Verify turned off, but
you won't be made aware of any errors, so it's better to leave
Verify turned on unless you completely trust your disks (you
really shouldn't).@{PAR}

This command will print all selected files, one at a time.
If you select only one file to print, the print routine will be
started up as a separate process, allowing you to continue
working with Directory Opus. To cancel this type of print,
simply select the print command again. A requester will appear
asking if you want to continue with the print or halt it. This
requester will also appear if you attempt to quit Directory Opus
while a print operation is in place, as you cannot quit until the
print has finished.@{PAR}

Even if you abort a print, the printer may not actually stop
for some time. This is because most printers have buffers, some
quite large ones, which store data for printing and will need to
empty themselves before the printout will stop.@{PAR}

The Print command automatically decrunches text crunched with various

@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}3.1 - Introduction@{ub}@{PAR}

The Opus Configuration utility is a powerful and easy-to-use instrument
for customising Directory Opus precisely to your tastes. Do you want to
use an interlace screen ?  Eight or sixteen colours ? Lots of buttons ?
Fancy buttons?  Directories sorted by date, in reverse order ?  Instant
access to various assignments ?  With ConfigOpus, these are but a few
of the myriad choices you can make.@{PAR}

Sophisticated though it is, the ConfigOpus utility is quick and easy to
use. This section is intended as a complete set of instructions for
users new to Directory Opus, and as a convenient reference for
experienced users.@{PAR}

Directory Opus uses a separate program to modify the configuration.
This saves approximately 130K of memory, as the configuration program
need only be in memory when it is being used. Not only that, but the
configuration program can be run independently of Directory Opus, if
you are really short on memory.@{PAR}

If you do have plenty of memory, however, Directory Opus can be
configured to load the configuration program on start-up. In this case,
it is run form memory each time the Configure program is invoked,
rather than loaded form disk. That can be much faster, especially if
you have a floppy based system.@{PAR}

From within Directory Opus, you can start up ConfigOpus by clicking on
the small C button on the lower right or selecting the "Configure" item
from the Project Menu.@{PAR}

From outside Directory Opus, you can start ConfigOpus by itself either
by double-clicking on the ConfigOpus icon or starting it from a CLI.@{PAR}

On the ConfigOpus screen there are several items of interest. At the
top of the screen you will see Screen Depth button and the Screen Title
Bar. The Screen Depth button allows the user to push the screen behind
the other screens opened.@{PAR}

You can press the Help key at any time to bring up help information. 
When you have questions about something on the screen, try here first.
If the Help button does not answer your question, then you can drag out
the manual.@{PAR}

@{FG highlight}NOTE:@{FG text}@{PAR}

The Help key does not work if a 'String Gadget' is active (i.e. if
ConfigOpus expects you to enter some text). In this case, deactivate
the String Gadget by clicking on an empty area in the window.@{PAR}

The Window Title Bar describes the current screen. It Doubles as the
Window Drag Bar, which allows you to drag the ConfigOpus window around.@{PAR}

configuration. On the ConfigOpus screen, these menus will allow you to
affect all the configuration data. When you select the Open item, you
load all the configuration data from that file, replacing any changes
that you have made with this new data.@{PAR}

On the other screens in ConfigOpus, the Open menu will only override
the information specific to that screen. For instance, on the
@{" Custom Button " link 3.4} screen only the Custom Button banks will be loaded from
a configuration file. This allows you to load banks of buttons that you
have defined in advance, so as to control the NewTek Video Toaster, for

The Default or Open... menu items in the Configure menu allow you
import custom button banks from either the default configuration or a

The Button Rows menu allows you to configure the actual number of rows of custom
buttons that will be displayed at one time on the main Directory Opus

The magnifying-glass button brings up a list of internal commands.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 3.6.1.Command_type.Executable "Configuration: Command Editor/Edit Fields/Command type/AmigaDOS"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}AmigaDOS@{ub}@{PAR}

This is for executable programs that will get launched as if you were running
them manually from the CLI. Thus, with an output window enabled, they can
receive keyboard input from the user and display output on the screen.@{PAR}

The magnifying-glass button brings up a file requester.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 3.6.1.Command_type.Workbench "Configuration: Command Editor/Edit fields/Command type/Workbench"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Workbench@{ub}@{PAR}

Workbench programs are also executable programs. They are launched,
however, as if you were double-clicking on their icons from Workbench.
This can be an advantage, as many programs do not take arguments, or do
not work at all if run from the CLI.@{PAR}

If the Workbench program given is a tool (i.e. an executable program),
Directory Opus will look for its icon file to determine the necessary
stack size to give to the program. If the icon cannot be located, the
stack size defined in the button, menu or filetype will be used.@{PAR}

If the Workbench program given is a project (a non-executable file
created by another program), Directory Opus will look for its icon file
to find its Default Tool, the actual program needed to load the file.
If the icon cannot be found, or a Default Tool can not be loaded
successfully, Directory Opus will not launch the file. The project's
icon is also used to determine stack size.@{PAR}

Workbench programs can also take arguments from Directory Opus using
the @{" {f} " link SimArgFun 7} and similar sequences. This can be very useful indeed.
DeluxePaint, for instance, does not accept arguments if run from the
CLI; you would be unable, therefore, to select a picture file for
DeluxePaint to load from Directory Opus if you were running DPaint as
an @{" AmigaDOS " link 3.6.1.Command_type.Executable} executable.@{PAR}

If, however, you have the command defined as:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

DPaint {f}@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

and have the Command type set to Workbench, DeluxePaint will be run as
a Workbench program. From the Workbench, DeluxePaint will accept
arguments, so the first file you selected would be loaded into DPaint
automatically.@{PAR}

The magnifying-glass button brings up a file requester.@{PAR}

You can @{" drag'n drop " link 1.10} Workbench icons over the Command Editor window and
ConfigOpus will add a Workbench Command entry.

@ENDNODE
@NODE 3.6.1.Command_type.Batch "Configuration: Command Editor/Edit fields/Command type/Batch"

@{b}Batch@{ub}@{PAR}

Batch files, also called script files, are files that you might run
with the @{" Execute Command " link Execute}, or with the execute command from the CLI.
Selecting a Command type as Batch will cause the file to be executed as
a script file.@{PAR}

The magnifying-glass button brings up a file requester. This file
requester is initially set to S: because this is where batch files come
from by default.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 3.6.1.Command_type.ARexx "Configuration: Command Editor/Edit Fields/Command type/ARexx"

This type indicates that the Command is an ARexx script. The script
will only be launched if ARexx is active in the system. Note that the
address of the ARexx port will be set automatically, you do not need to
use the ARexx ADDRESS command to address the command to Directory Opus.@{PAR}

The magnifying-glass button brings up a file requester. This file
requester is initially set to Rexx: because this is the place ARexx
files come from by default.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 3.6.1.dotf "Configuration: Command Editor/Edit Fields/Flags"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Directory Opus to front@{ub}@{PAR}

Causes the Directory Opus screen to be brought to the front when the

@{" Workbench To Front " link 3.6.1.wtf}. If enabled in conjunction with
@{" Run Asynchronously " link 3.6.1.ra} and @{" Output Window " link 3.6.1.ow}, this flag will have slightly

opened on the Workbench screen as normal, but the Workbench screen will
not be brought to the front.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 3.6.1.daf "Configuration: Command Editor/Edit Fields/Flags"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Do all files@{ub}@{PAR}

This causes the Commands to act on each selected entry in turn, instead
of just the first entry. This is used for commands that do not support
multiple filenames on the command line, where @{" {F} " link SimArgFun 14} to send all
selected entries would not work.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 3.6.1.ids "Configuration: Command Editor/Edit Fields/Flags"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Include DOpus-Startup@{ub}@{PAR}

Makes Directory Opus execute a file called S:DOpus-Startup before any
external Commands are actually executed. This is used in the same way
as the @{" Shell-Startup " link 3.6.1.iss} file, but is distinct from the Shell-Startup
file, and therefore allows you to put into it any Directory Opus
specific commands.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 3.6.1.iss "Configuration: Command Editor/Edit Fields/Flags"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Include Shell-Startup@{ub}@{PAR}

If this option is enabled, then Directory Opus will execute the

@ENDNODE
@NODE 3.6.1.nfq "Configuration: Command Editor/Edit Fields/Flags"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}No filename quote@{ub}@{PAR}

This option enables Directory Opus to operate correctly with some older
or poorly written software. Normally, whenever Directory Opus sends a 
filename to a custom Command with the @{" {f} " link SimArgFun 7}, @{" {o} " link SimArgFun 35}, etc. flags, the
filename is enclosed in quotation marks. This allows you to use
filenames containing spaces with external programs. However, some
software does not interpret the quotation marks correctly. If you find
this is the case with any program, simply select the No filename quote flag.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 3.6.1.ow "Configuration: Command Editor/Edit Fields/Flags"

@{b}Output window@{ub}@{PAR}

Opens a window for output from these Commands. The window will open on
the Directory Opus screen, unless the @{" Workbench to front " link 3.6.1.wtf} option
or the @{" Run asynchronously " link 3.6.1.ra} option is enabled. In this case, it will
open on the Workbench screen, and the Workbench screen will be brought

@{b}Output to file@{ub}@{PAR}

Redirects all output from the Commands to a temporary file in T:
directory, which is then red via the @{" text viewer " link 2.7}. This
allows you to read the output of a program thoroughly, and even to
print it. Note that if you are sending output to a file, the Command
cannot receive input from the keyboard.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 3.6.1.rd "Configuration: Command Editor/Edit Fields/Flags"

@{b}Recursive directories@{ub}@{PAR}

Allows the Command access to files within sub-directories. Normally,
whenever a @{" {f} " link SimArgFun 7} or @{" {F} " link SimArgFun 13} or similar sequence would result in the
name of a directory being included in the same way as a file. In other
words, the Command would not act recursively on all files within the
directory.@{PAR}

If this option is enabled, the names of all files within that
directory, and within sub-directories within the directory, and so on,
are included in the program's parameters. This allows the Command to
act on all files in the directory and not just on the directory itself.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 3.6.1.ref "Configuration: Command Editor/Edit Fields/Flags"

@{b}Reload each file@{ub}@{PAR}

Causes Directory Opus to rescan a file after it has been acted upon by

@NODE 3.9 "Configuration: Filetypes Manager"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}3.9 - Filetypes Manager@{ub}@{PAR}

A file is simply stored data. Files can contain executable programs,
IFF pictures, Icons for Workbench, or a multitude of other kinds of
data. Most (but not all) files have an identifiable structure.
Directory Opus's FileTypes system is designed to examine a file's
structure and identify the kind (or Type) of data it contains. You can
configure Directory Opus to understand an unlimited number of
Filetypes.@{PAR}

Filetypes are a versatile feature of Directory Opus. Using filetypes,
you can configure Directory Opus to play animations when they are 
double-clicked, to load a database program when you attempt to "Read"
a database file, or to uncompress an archived file when you
@{" Click-M-Click " link glos} on it.@{PAR}

This is the essence of the Filetypes: when you do something to a file,
Directory Opus can figure out what kind of file it is and take the
appropriate action for that type of data.@{PAR}

There are two sections to the Filetypes configuration:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

@{" Filetypes " link 3.9.1}@{PAR}

There is a list of Filetypes which is searched when an action
occurs. If the file being processed matches a FileType, you can
configure Directory Opus to perform a specific action.@{PAR}

@{" File Classes " link 3.11}@{PAR}

There is a DataBase of File Class definitions. Each describes the
process of matching a particular kind of File. Directory Opus
comes with more File Classes than you will probably use. You can
select from this list when you are creating a new Filetype entry.
You don't have to be an expert or know anything about the internal
structure of the file to do this.@{PAR}

The @{" File Class Manager " link 3.11} allows you to edit existing File
Classes, or define new ones. (This can be somewhat more
complicated.)@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 3.9.1 "Configuration: Filetypes Manager/Filetypes"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Filetypes@{ub}@{PAR}

The Filetypes configuration screen displays the list of filetypes that
Directory Opus recognises. By default,it recognises LHA archives, ARC
archives, ZOO archive, and Workbench icons.@{PAR}

There are five buttons across the bottom of the screen. Some of these
buttons when selected with the left mouse button stay selected. For
instance Delete will stay selected indicating that you are now in
delete mode. To leave this mode simply select Delete again. Both the
Delete and Swap buttons work in this fashion.@{PAR}

The buttons available are:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}


@{i}New @{ui}@{PAR}

This allows you to create a new filetype entry based on a 
predefined File Class. When you select this button a requester
appears containing currently defined classes. To create a new
entry for one of these File Classes simply select it and you will
be brought to the @{" filetype action editor " link 3.10}.@{PAR}

@{i}Swap @{ui}@{PAR}

This button allows you to exchange the positions of two Filetypes
in the list. This can be very useful or even necessary. In the
case of having two filetypes defined in which one is a sub-set of
the other, e.g., 24 bit ILBM pictures versus regular IFF ILBM
picture filetype. Otherwise, pictures (in this case) will be
matched with the regular IFF ILBM picture filetype and will never
have a chance to match with the sub-set 24 bit ILBM picture filetype.@{PAR}

To actually perform a swap, click on the Swap button to enter that
mode. Click on the first filetype, then on the second. Those two
filetypes will exchange places in the list. To exit swap mode
simply press Swap a second time.@{PAR}

@{i}Delete @{ui}@{PAR}

In this mode you can select filetypes to remove from the list.
Click on the Delete button, then click on the entries you wish to
delete. If you accidentally delete an entry, click on the Cancel
button.@{PAR}

@{i}Okay and Cancel @{ui}@{PAR}

These buttons allow you to say "OK, let's use all these filetypes
changes and of back to ConfigOpus' main screen", or "Oops! Forget
all this and let's just leave".@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}


To edit a filetype, make sure you are not in Swap or Delete mode. Then
simply select it. You will then be taken to the @{" Filetype Editor " link 3.10} screen.@{PAR}

difference is that a custom button can only be activated by being
clicked on; the commands available for editing Filetypes can be
activated in several ways.@{PAR}

@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Events...@{ub}@{PAR}

At the top of the Filetypes Editor is a list of Event types, which are
instructions you may choose to give Directory Opus regarding Filetypes.
Each of the Events is associated to either a mouse action or a
Directory Opus command, so each entry on the list is tagged either
@{" Action " link 3.10.1} or @{" Command " link 3.10.2}. An asterisk * indicates that this entry already
has an Event Command List defined for it. Clicking on an entry in the
list highlights it to show that it is the Command List currently being
edited. The current Command List is displayed in the editing list in
the middle of the screen. The The small field immediately above it
describes the Event.@{PAR}

While each of these Event types can be defined to do something, usually
only a few are actually defined. It certainly is not necessary to
define all Events for a Filetype.@{PAR}

When one of these Events is activated, Directory Opus does the
following:@{PAR}

It first searches the Filetypes list, starting with the first entry,
and checks whether it matches the entry's File Class.@{PAR}

If it matches, it looks to see if the corresponding Event is defined
from this Editor. If it is defined, it performs the Command List.@{PAR}

If it does not match the File Class, or if it matches and does not have
a Command List defined, it continues to search the Filetypes List. It
is possible for it to match a subsequent entry that does have a Command
List defined.@{PAR}

@{b}Mouse Action Events@{ub}@{PAR}

Mouse Events occur when you either Double-click on a file or perform a
Click-m-click.@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

@{i}Double-click @{ui}@{PAR}

This occurs when you double click on a file. A popular use of this
is to examine a file (e.g. show it if it is a picture or play it
if it is a sound). The actual double click speed is defined by the
operating system's preference program.@{PAR}

@{i}@{" Click-M-Click " link glos} @{ui}@{PAR}

This Event occurs when a file is clicked on then the mouse is
moved to the other window and clicked. One popular use of this
Event is for archive extracting. Another way this Event can happen
is by using @{" Click-Drag-Release " link glos}. With this you literally drag a
file into the window and drop it there.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 3.10.2 "Configuration: Filetypes Editor/Events"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Command Events@{ub}@{PAR}

Command Events are called when a file is acted upon by a Directory Opus
command. For example, when a @{" Read " link 1.6.Read} Command is performed on a file,
Directory Opus will search for a @{" Filetype " link 3.9} which matches the file
and has a Read Event defined. You could, however, have Read do
something special for an archive ( i.e. list the contents of the
archive). Likewise if you have a music score you could define the
@{" Play " link 1.6.Play} (or @{" LoopPlay " link 1.6.Loop_Play}) to call up your player for that music score.@{PAR}

Each of the following Command Events is associated with a corresponding
Directory Opus command. This allows you to redefine the specific action
taken for a particular filetype. By convention you should use a command
Event for something similar to its normal use, but there is nothing to
stop you from giving a command Event a label that is totally irrelevant
to its use. It's up to you to keep the context of the command (i.e. a
Read would be confusing if it did a Disk Format).@{PAR}

The following list describes the normal usages. You can decide what you
want it to mean for any given filetype.@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

@{" AnsiRead " link AnsiRead}  Fancy text viewer@{PAR}
@{" HexRead  " link HexRead}  Binary or Hexadecimal file viewer@{PAR}
@{" LoopPlay " link LoopPlay}  Normally associated with playing sounds in loops@{PAR}
@{" Play     " link Play}  Playing sounds@{PAR}
@{" Read     " link Read}  Simple text viewer or viewer contents of archives@{PAR}
@{" Show     " link Show}  Picture viewer@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

@{FG highlight}User Events:@{FG text}@{PAR}

The terms @{" User1, User2, User3, and User4 " link User1} may seem cryptic, but
they are here to give you flexibility. Each of the preceding
commands has an implied usage, but you may have an application
which doesn't really mean any of these. In that case, you can
decide that one of these User Events means "Perform this special
operation".@{PAR}

Directory Opus' default configuration employs User1 for extracting
from archives.@{PAR}

Once you have made a filetype entry based on a
@{" File Class definition " link 3.12.1.fcid} then you must use the Edit Class button
on the filetype editor screen.@{PAR}

When you make a Filetype, it uses a copy of the File Class in the
actual filetype entry. This had several important results. Once a
Filetype is made, you can edit its File Class definition without
changing the original definition. The Edit Class button on the
filetype editor allows you to so this. Selecting Edit from the
Classes Menu allows you to edit the original File Class
Definition. This will not automatically update any Filetypes which
used the original definition. You can even delete the original
File Class without affecting a filetype which used it.@{PAR}

The field viewer at the top of the screen is simply a file viewer. To
view a file, type its name into the field or click on the magnifying-
glass to bring up a file requester. The file selected will appear below
the field. It will be displayed in Hex/ASCII format similar to the
@{" HexRead " link HexRead} command in Directory Opus itself.@{PAR}

You may wonder why we have a file viewer on this screen. We have found
that when creating a new File Class definition it is useful to have a
way to look at files, since you are trying to describe to Directory
Opus a way of identifying files.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 3.12.0.dec "Configuration: File Class Editor"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Decimal/Hex@{ub}@{PAR}

To the right of the file viewer is a button that cycles from Decimal to

Position and Offset information in the two read-only fields below the
cycle button.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 3.12.0.example "Configuration: File Class Editor"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}An Example@{ub}@{PAR}

The simplest way to show how this all works is with an example. Select
the field "C:ED" (by either typing into the field or using the
magnifying-glass file requester).@{PAR}

The format of the data in the file viewer is as follows: The first
column is the address into the file we are looking at. The next four
columns are 16 bytes of data from the file in hexadecimal format. The
last column is simply those 16 bytes in ASCII format. Where there is a
byte that '00' or null we display it in ASCII as a period.@{PAR}

Position your mouse pointer over the 'F3' characters and press the left
mouse button. A cursor will appear on 'F3' and the position field
(read-only) will be filled in with '000000003'. This means that the
cursor is positioned on the 4th byte in the file (remember: byte
locations are zero relative, that is, first byte is at location zero).
If you click the cycle button above the position read-only field and
change it to Hex then the position will be filled in with '$000000003'
which is hexadecimal for three. You can move the cursor around in the
file with either the mouse pointer (simply select another place in the
file) or the cursor keys.@{PAR}

Now double click on the 'F3' characters. This time the characters
change colour. They are now the position from which offsets are
computed. Move the cursor by pressing the down key a few times and you
will notice the offset read-only field contains the offset from the
double-click position.@{PAR}

The general structure of the File Class definition script is that there

@{b}Match: Match text or $hex.@{ub}@{PAR}

This states that a sequence of bytes starting at the current file
offset must match the given pattern. To match a single unknown
character when text is given, use the ? character. To match a single
unknown byte when $hex is given use two of them (??). You can also use
\\xxx syntax in text to specify ASCII characters by their decimal
number. A \\009 would be a tab character, a \\114 would be the lower
case r.@{PAR}

Note:@{PAR}

The "Match" and @{" MatchI " link 3.12.4.MatchI} testing directives will

@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Copy@{ub}@{PAR}

@{i}Check destination's free space before starting @{ui}@{PAR}

----------@{PAR}

Important Note!@{PAR}

This option is heavily outdated. It only knowns about FFS partitions with
512 Bytes per block. It will fail (in other words: report wrong results) on any
partition that does not match these specs exactly. Always disable this option unless
you're sure that all of your partitions are FFS, 512 Bytes/block!@{PAR}

----------@{PAR}

This causes Directory Opus to check that the destination directory
has enough free space in it before attempting to copy selected
files and/or directories. If Directory Opus doesn't think that all
selected entries will fit in the destination directory, it will
alert you with a requester, and give you the option of abandoning
the copy process. If any selected directories do not have sizes
displayed for them, Directory Opus will ask you if you wish it to
perform a byte count on these directories before seeing whether or
not they will fit.@{PAR}

@{i}Set archive bit of source after finishing @{ui}@{PAR}

After Directory Opus copies a file, the original file will get its
archive bit set to true. This means that the file had been
archived.@{PAR}

@{i}Also copy source's... @{ui}@{PAR}

These flags tell Directory Opus that when it copies a file, it
must also copy these parts of the file information as well. You
can have all, none, or any combination of the following selected:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

 - Datestamp@{PAR}

@{LINDENT 1}

@{i}What to do when a file already exists... @{ui}@{PAR}

These flags tell Directory Opus what to do if a file that is being
copied already exists in the destination. Only one of these may be
selected. You have four options:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

@{i}Always replace files @{ui}@{PAR}

Replaces the original file regardless.@{PAR}

@{i}Never replace files @{ui}@{PAR}

Will never replace the original file.@{PAR}

@{i}Replace only older files @{ui}@{PAR}

Replace the original file only is the file to be copied has a
more recent last modification date.@{PAR}

may choose whichever one you prefer:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

- DD-MMM-YY (22-Sep-92)@{PAR}

Directory Opus be displayed in 12 hour or 24 hour format.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE 3.17.3 "Configuration: Operation/Delete"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Delete@{ub}@{PAR}

@{i}Ask before commencing delete @{ui}@{PAR}

Tells Directory Opus to check with you before actually starting
to delete. This is a rather useful everyday option because it's
always better to be safe than sorry.@{PAR}

@{i}Ask before deleting files @{ui}@{PAR}

Tells Directory Opus to ask for confirmation before deleting
each file.@{PAR}

@{i}Ask before deleting non-empty directories @{ui}@{PAR}

Tells Directory Opus to ask for confirmation before deleting
directories that have items in them.@{PAR}

@{i}Ignore the delete protection bit @{ui}@{PAR}

When deleting, this sets the Delete protection bit on all files
that do not have it set. This means that the files protected
against deletion will be deleted anyway.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE

@{i}Display info @{ui}@{PAR}

Makes Directory Opus behave as it did in version 1, by displaying
a file's @{" protection bits " link 2.1 10}, datestamp and comment in the status
bar. Directory Opus now displays these in the directory windows,
and keeps a count of selected files, etc. in the status bar
instead. If you prefer the old-style display, turn Display info
on. All file information will be displayed in the status bar as
you select entries, as well as in the directory windows. With this
turned on, you can use the @{" GetSizes " link GetSizes} Command to view the count
of selected entries.@{PAR}

@{i}File double-click @{ui}@{PAR}

Directory Opus will interrogate a file that is double-clicked on
with the left mouse button, and will perform the default action
for that Filetype.@{PAR}

You may define your own Filetypes, and specify what action is to
be performed on them. However, there are also several hard-coded
Filetypes. These are IFF ILBM pictures and brushes, icons, fonts,
IFF 8SVX sounds, and Amiga executable programs.@{PAR}

If a file does not match any of the user-defined Filetypes, it is
checked to see if is one of the hard-coded types. In that case,
the default action for these Filetypes is performed. If a file
does not match any Filetypes, user-defined or otherwise, it is
treated as a text file, and loaded into the @{" text viewer " link 2.7}. If any
ANSI control sequences are detected, these will be displayed
correctly. If the file contains any non-text characters, it will
be read in hexadecimal format.@{PAR}

@{i}Window slider activate @{ui}@{PAR}

Causes a directory window to become active whenever its sliders or

Whatever happens to a file will happen to that file's icon as
well. For instance, if you delete the file DATA, DATA.info (if it
exists) will be deleted too. If you rename the file FROG to PIG,
then FROG.info (if it exists) will be renamed as PIG.info
automatically.@{PAR}

re-read the directory to reflect the changes.@{PAR}

@{i}Redraw more than a quarter of a page @{ui}@{PAR}

Causes Directory Opus to redraw the window if you move more than
a quarter of a page in either direction. This flag can greatly
speed up movement through directories. Ordinarily, if you use the
sliders to move a directory less than a complete page in either
direction, the directory window will scroll one file at a time.
It is only if you move a complete page or more at once that the
window will actually be redrawn. Although not as pleasing
aesthetically, redrawing is considerably faster, especially in
high-resolution modes.@{PAR}

@{i}Always move to empty buffer @{ui}@{PAR}

Causes Directory Opus to use an empty buffer (if possible)
whenever a new directory is read. A new directory is read
whenever you enter a path in the directory fields, double-click
or @{" Click-M-Click " link glos} on a directory name, or select a drive
button.@{PAR}

@{i}Re-read changed or incomplete buffers @{ui}@{PAR}

When a buffered directory is shown, this will make Directory
Opus check the directory on disk to see if it has changed. If
it has, this will cause a re-read of the directory. Also, if
the original reading of a directory was interrupted it will be
re-read in.@{PAR}

This option causes the directory buffers to be searched for the
parent or root directory of the current directory, whenever the
@{" Parent " link 1.6.Parent} or @{" Root " link 1.6.Root} Commands are chosen. If the parent or root
directory exists in a buffer (i.e. it has already been read), the

@{i}Auto diskchange @{ui}@{PAR}

Causes Directory Opus to sense disk changes in any drive. If you
have the root directory open in either of the directory windows
when you change the disk, then the new disk will be read
automatically. This allows you to scan through different disks
without having to follow the usual selection procedure.@{PAR}

@{i}Auto disk load @{ui}@{PAR}

This option works in a similar fashion to Auto diskchange,
except that it detects any disk being inserted, not just those
disks currently displayed. If you insert a disk in a floppy
drive with this option turned on, you will be asked whether you
wish to read the disk into the left or the right window.@{PAR}

@{i}Expand pathnames @{ui}@{PAR}

This flag will cause all paths to be expanded to their full
pathnames. For example, if this flag was enabled and you entered
S: in the directory field, the name might be expanded to
Workbench:S/. It will also do this when you select a drive
button. For instance, if you selected a drive button marked DF0:,
the actual name of the disk be inserted in the directory field.@{PAR}

You should note that as the Expand pathnames flag causes the
actual volume name of disks to be used, the system (and you) may
get confused when using two disks with the same name. As a rule,
you should avoid using identically-named disks at the same time.@{PAR}

@{i}Use ExAll() @{ui}@{PAR}

If selected, Directory Opus will use the ExAll() command to read
directories, rather than the old Examine()/ExNext() combination.
ExAll() can be slightly faster than the old method.@{PAR}

NOTE:@{PAR}

It is recommended that you always leave this function enabled. ExAll()
appeared in OS3.0 and as any new thing it required some time to be
correctly handled by other filesystems than FFS. Anyway, any disk filesystem
should handle it properly by now. But there are some possible troublemakers.
Parnet has some problems for example, but not only with ExAll().@{PAR}

So disable ExAll() only to work with buggy filesystems and reenable it just
after finishing the work.@{PAR}

one of four things:@{PAR}

If Directory Opus is iconified, it will be uniconified.@{PAR}

If the Directory Opus screen is open, but at the back of the

again.@{PAR}

To remove the Hotkey simply select the Sample button with the
right mouse button.@{PAR}

The default Hotkeys are CONTROL + LSHIFT + LALT, meaning that

@{b}Command Reference Information@{ub}@{PAR}

This section lists the Directory Opus commands in alphabetical order.
Let's begin with an example of an entry's layout, with its component
parts explained as they occur:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

command  argument  [argument2]@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

This is the syntax of the command. Elements in square brackets are optional.@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

@{" ARexx Only " link ComRefInf 8} / @{" Internal Only " link ComRefInf}@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

If one of those buttons follows the syntax description of the command, it means that it is a
command that can only be used either from ARexx (the Amiga's inbuilt intercommunication
language) or for buttons (menus, hotkeys or filetypes).
Otherwise, a command can be used both in a button and as an ARexx command.@{PAR}

Below the syntax (or the "Arexx Only" button), the syntax elements are explained in turn.@{PAR}

If necessary, there will follow notes pertaining to the use of the
particular command.@{PAR}

@{FG highlight}Using DirOpus' commands from ARexx@{FG text}@{PAR}

All Directory Opus commands when called from ARexx respond with two
variables: RC (the error status code) and Result. RC will always be an
integer value indicating the severity of an error, 0 being no error.
Result will indicate success or failure of the command, usually
expressed as an integer value, or it may be data, such as the name of
a file.@{PAR}

               adds at the end of the list, defaults to -1.@{PAR}


This is similar to the @{" AddFile " link AddFile} command, but allows for entries of
up to 256 characters. Entries added with this command are completely user-defined.@{PAR}

This command will fail if there are any normal entries already in
the active window, so you should always call @{" Clear Win " link ClearWin} before using it.
By default, entries are not sorted in any way; The most recent entry
will be shown as the last.@{PAR}

             (-1 = current window, 0 = left or 1 = right)@{PAR}
             defaults to -1.@{PAR}


This command will attach an ARexx portname to the current
directory buffer. When you manipulate the buffer's entries, Directory
Opus will pass messages to the specified portname. This command is
only used with buffers created using @{" AddCustEntry " link AddCustEntry}. Currently the only
two actions supported are Double-Click and @{" Click-M-Click " link Glos}. As an
example, this system could be used to create a phonebook system or a
NetWork manager with Directory Opus.@{PAR}

   NAME  optional; name of file


This will add icons to all selected files and directories in the
active directory window. Directory Opus automatically senses what sort
of file it is (drawer, project, tool, etc.) and will add the
appropriate icon. Under OS2.0, however, we use the Workbench default
icons. You may specify your own icons in the ConfigOpus if the default
icons are not suitable. You may also specify the Default Tool to be
used for project icons. If the name is not given, it will use the
first available selected item in the current directory window.@{PAR}

@{b}AnsiRead  [NAME]@{ub}@{PAR}


   NAME  optional; name of file@{PAR}


This command operates in exactly the same way as the @{" READ " link Read} command,
except that it displays ANSI control sequences (colours and
typestyles) properly, and also handles tab characters correctly. If
the name is not given it will use the first available selected item in
the current directory window.@{PAR}

@NODE ARexx "Tech Guide/Commands"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}ARexx [COMMAND]@{ub}@{PAR}


 COMMAND  optional; command to execute@{PAR}


This allows you to launch an ARexx script or execute a
Directory Opus ARexx command from within Directory Opus. If the
command is not given a requester will open asking the user for one.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE Assign "Tech Guide/Commands"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Assign [NAME]@{ub}@{PAR}


   NAME  optional; name to assign@{PAR}

This command allows you to assign a logical device name to the
currently active directory. The C: device is an example of a logical
device; it is not a physical disk itself, but is a directory that has
been assigned the name C:. For example, a simple name as Text: can be
assigned to a long and complicated pathname such as:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

DH0:Projects/Work/1989/April/Bits&Pieces/Text@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

From then on, whenever you enter Text: into a directory field,
you will go straight to the directory at the end of the assigned path,
instead of having to go through all the sub-directories on the way.
You can use the assignment in any other program as well. Logical
device names always end with a colon.@{PAR}

"Assign" also allows you to cancel a previously assigned logical
device, or reassign a device to another directory. To do this, press
the right mouse button over the S (select) button to activate the
@{" GetDevices " link GetDevices} command. Select the assigned device(s) you wish to change,
and invoke the "Assign" command. A requester will appear, into which you
can type the new pathname to be assigned to each device selected. If you
enter a blank string, that logical device will be removed.@{PAR}

channels. You could use this command to signify that a command has
finished. For instance, you could modify the @{" Diskcopy " link 1.9.2.Disk_Copy} option to read:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

   WIN  optional; window to scan the buffer list into@{PAR}
        (-1 = current window, 0 = left or 1 = right)@{PAR}
        defaults to -1.@{PAR}


This command displays a list of all the buffered directories. You
may then double-click on one of the displayed buffers to jump to that
buffer immediately, rather than clicking the arrows to cycle through
the buffers one by one.@{PAR}

         or 6. Defaults to whatever Directory Opus is set to.@{PAR}

   BANK  optional; bank number to display initially,@{PAR}
         defaults to 1.@{PAR}


This causes Directory Opus to open a window on Workbench
containing the Custom Buttons. For more details see ButtonIconify
@{" menu item " link 1.9.1.Button_Iconified}.@{PAR}

This command allows you to set the current working directory
for Directory Opus. This is the directory that is read if you press
return on an empty directory button.@{PAR}

@NODE CheckAbort  "Tech Guide/Commands"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}CheckAbort@{ub}@{PAR}

@{" ARexx Only " link ComRefInf 8}@{PAR}

This command allows you to monitor, from an ARexx script, whether
the user has pressed the left and right mouse buttons together (to
abort). It also resets the Abort flag every time it is called. If you
plan to use the CheckAbort command, you should call CheckAbort at the
start of the script ( to reset the Abort flag), before actually using
it to check the abort status.@{PAR}


ARexx Results:@{PAR}@{PAR}

@{" RC " link ComRefInf 24} = 0@{PAR}

@{" Result " link ComRefInf 24} = 0 if abort sequence has not been hit, 1 if it has.@{PAR}

@NODE CheckFit "Tech Guide/Commands"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}CheckFit  [WIN]@{ub}@{PAR}


   WIN  optional; window to a CheckFit on @{PAR}
        (-1 = current window, 0 = left or 1 = right)@{PAR}
        defaults to -1.@{PAR}


----------@{PAR}

@{fg highlight}Important Note!@{fg text}@{PAR}

This command is heavily outdated. It only knowns about FFS partitions with
512 Bytes per block. It will fail (in other words: report wrong results) on any
partition that does not match these specs exactly. Avoid this command if you're
not sure that all of your partitions are FFS, 512 Bytes/block!@{PAR}

----------@{PAR}

This works in the same way as @{" GetSizes " link GetSizes} does except that its
calculation is based on disk block sizes, and is therefore much more
accurate.@{PAR}

The disadvantage of CheckFit is that it needs to recalculate every
time the destination's block size changes. Therefore, even if all
source directories already have their sizes shown, CheckFit may need to
scan them all again. Operations like @{" Copy " link Copy}, etc., that generate
directory sizes, are not suitable for CheckFit, and so again CheckFit
will need to scan all selected directories.@{PAR}

CheckFit displays the total number of bytes needed and the number
of bytes free (i.e., block number multiplied by the block size), and
the percentage of files that will actually fit. If they will all fit,
it shows 100%, if only half of them will fit, it shows 50%.@{PAR}

The GetSizes command is retained as it can be used quickly to
provide a rough guide. CheckFit can completely replace the GetSizes
command if you don't mind it having to rescan directories when you
might not have expected it.@{PAR}

@NODE ClearBuffers "Tech Guide/Commands"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}ClearBuffers@{ub}@{PAR}

This command will clear the contents of all the directory buffers
other than the two that are currently displayed. All unused memory
will be de-allocated. This is a good way to free memory quickly if you
have lots of used buffers and are running a bit low on memory.@{PAR}

        defaults to -1.@{PAR}


If directory's size is already displayed, then the directory will
not be re-scanned when selected nor the @{" GetSizes " link GetSizes} command invoked. This
could mean that the directory size is inaccurate, especially if any
files have been created or deleted in it by another program. Selecting
one or more directories, and then selecting the ClearSizes command, 
will cause the directory sizes to disappear. You can then reselect the
directories, invoke the GetSizes command, and the directories will be 
re-scanned and their updated sizes displayed.@{PAR}

Have you ever had files that you wanted to encrypt so that only

allows you to do just that. It will encrypt all selected files, using
a password that you enter, with a complex algorithm that most people
will find impossible to work out. The resulting files are not written
over the originals, but are instead written to the destination
directory. They will be the same size as the original files, so you
can ensure you have enough room in the destination directory.@{PAR}

To decrypt a previously encrypted file, you should enter the same
password preceded by a minus sign. For example, to decrypt files you
encrypted with the password FOO, select the files, choose the encrypt
command and enter -FOO as the password.@{PAR}

your disks, leave Verify on.@{PAR}

The FFS option in Format allows you to format a disk to use the

less than 2.0, you will still be able to select this option to format a
disk. However, reading FFs-formatted disks is impossible without 2.0

@{b}Iconify@{ub}@{PAR}

This command closes the Directory Opus window and screen, de-
allocates as much memory as possible, and then opens a small window on
the Workbench screen. This is known as iconifying, and allows you to
have Directory Opus constantly available while using the minimum amount
of memory.@{PAR}

To determine the initial position of the iconified window,
especially if you start up Directory Opus in the iconified state, you
should inconify Directory Opus, and position the window as you would
like it to appear. Then re-enter Directory Opus and save the
configuration using @{" SaveConfig " link SaveConfig}.@{PAR}

To re-enter Directory Opus, simply click the left mouse button in
the iconified window, then press the right mouse button. If you wish
to quit Directory Opus without going back into it, just click the Close
button at the far left of the iconified window.@{PAR}

If you have the configuration option Iconify Type set to hidden,
the only way to re-enter Directory Opus is with the hotkeys. These
default to CTRL-SHIFT-ALT (the CTRL key, the left SHIFT key and the
left ALT key held down simultaneously), although this may be changed
in the @{" configuration " link 3.19.4} using @{" Configure " link configure}.@{PAR}

similar fashion to the Information option in the Icon menu of 
Workbench.@{PAR}

To use this command you may either select the info files
themselves or the actual files or directories the icons belong to.@{PAR}

A requester will appear when you run this command on a valid icon.
The actual appearance of the requester will vary depending on the type
of icon, but in all cases the actual icon imagery will be displayed.
You click on this image with the left mouse button to display the
alternative imagery (if it exists).@{PAR}

The Remap colours button will swap colours 1 and 2 of the icon
displayed. This can be useful to remap icons designed under OS1.3 for
usage under OS2.0, since OS2.0 swapped the light and dark colours
around.@{PAR}

         DATE  optional; match on date@{PAR}

When used in name mode (default) this command allows you to select
files and directories in the active directory window using wildcards.
All standard @{" wildcards " link wldcrdpat} are supported.@{PAR}

When used in date mode you can select all files and directories
created or modified on a certain date only. Simply enter that date
(e.g. 28-Mar-90 would select all entries with datestamps set to any
time on the 28th of March, 1990). You can also use word like
Yesterday, Today, Tuesday, etc. If you can also specify a specific
time. Simply enter the time (in the format HH:MM:SS). If you enter a
time, however, the datestamp must match that time exactly for the
entry to be selected. If you enter a time but not a date it will
select files created today that match that time.@{PAR}

You can also select a range of dates. For instance, to select all
entries created or modified between the 18th of April, 1989 and the
22nd of September, 1991, you would enter:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

18-Apr-89 > 22-Sep-91@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

The > character does not in this case signify "greater than"; it
simply indicates a range of dates. It must have at least one space on
either side of it.@{PAR}

To select all files from the beginning of time to, for instance,
the 3rd of January, 1990, you would enter:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

> 3-Jan-91
@{LINDENT 1}

To select all files from, for example, the 12th of July, 1983 to
the current date (today) you would enter:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

12-Jul-83 >@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

You may also specify times when entering date ranges.@{PAR}

If used in protect bit mode you may specify protection bits that
are allowed to be set, and bits that are not. If a bit or group of
bits is allowed to be set, precede it with a + character. If a bit or
group of bits is not allowed to be set precede it with a - character.
The initial + character is assumed. For instance, to select all
readable and writeable files, you would simply enter:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

rw@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

Or, you could enter:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

+rw@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

Both these would have the same effect. To expand upon this, and
select all readable and writeable files, but not those that have the
hidden or archive bits set, you would enter:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

rw-ha@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

Or, to select files that do not have the bits SPED set, you would
enter:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

-sped@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

The Select command is additive; i.e. entries not matching the
given pattern are not deselected.@{PAR}

This command returns the value for the specified status command
(listed below). If the set keyword is specified, this command will set
the status to the specified value (if appropriate for that status
command). Most status values can be set.@{PAR}

Some status commands require a sub-number. An example of this is
status 4, which returns the total number of files in a specific
directory window. The directory window may be either 0 (for the left-
hand window), 1 (for the right-hand window) or -1 (for the active
window). The command would therefore be status 4 0 for the left-hand
window, and status 4 1 for the right-hand window.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE WldCrdPat "Tech Guide/Wild Card Patterns"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Wild Card Patterns@{ub}@{PAR}

Directory Opus can use wild cards to make some tasks easier. Wild card
characters are expressions that tell Directory Opus to match (or not
match, in some cases) more than just one character. You may already
have encountered pattern matching in the discussion of the Rename
command.@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}


?  This token will match any single character, but does not@{PAR}
   include none. For example, FI?E would match FILE, FINE and@{PAR}
   FIRE but not FIE.@{PAR}

#  This character tells Directory Opus to match the following@{PAR}
   expression) or more times. For instance, FRE#D would match@{PAR}
   FRE, FRED, FREDD, FREDDD, etc. "#?" will match anything, just@{PAR}
   like "*" (see below).@{PAR}

() is in effect an or. (p1|p2|p3) will match on any one of the@{PAR}
   patterns p1, p2, and p3. For instance, (D*G|C*T) would match@{PAR}
   DOG, CAT, DIG, COT, etc. You may include as many patterns@{PAR}
   inside the parentheses as you like, separated by vertical bars@{PAR}
   (|).@{PAR}

|  Use this token within parentheses to separate different@{PAR}
   expressions you wish to match at the same time. For example,@{PAR}
   "(ab|cd)" will match any one of the items separated by "|"@{PAR}
   (here, "ab" and "cd").@{PAR}

%  Matches 0 characters. This is always (useful in an instance@{PAR}
   like "(foo/bar/%)"). Another example: "CA(M/%)P" will match@{PAR}
   CAMP and CAP.@{PAR}

*  Synonym for "#?", an asterisk will match any number of@{PAR}
   repetitions of any characters, including none. For instance,@{PAR}
   "F*" will match F, FR, FRE, FRED, FREDD, FREDDY, etc.@{PAR}

~  The tilde can be used to negate an expression. Anything that @{PAR}
   would normally match, now will not match. For example,@{PAR}
   "F~(ROFG)" will match FROM but not FROG, "~J*" will not match@{PAR}
   anything starting with J.@{PAR}

[] Brackets enclose a list of characters (a "character class")@{PAR}
   that match any of the characters in the class. "[abc]" tells@{PAR}
   Directory Opus to match either "a", "b", or "c" in this@{PAR}
   position.@{PAR}

~  A tilde at the beginning of a character class matches any@{PAR}
   characters that are not in the class. For example, "[~bc]"@{PAR}
   says "match any character except "b" or "c".@{PAR}

-  A hyphen indicates a character range (only within character@{PAR}
   classes). The expression "[a-z]" represents all the lower case@{PAR}
   letters from "a" to "z".@{PAR}

'  (apostrophe or single quote) Use this character to declare the@{PAR}
   following character to be a literal character, used as it @{PAR}
   stands instead of as a wildcard. This permits you to use the@{PAR}
   characters #, ?, |, %, (,), [,], *, ~ and even an apostrophe as@{PAR}
   themselves rather than as pattern-matching control characters.@{PAR}
   For instance, YEAR*'% will match YEAR1989%, YEAR1990% but not@{PAR}
   YEAR 1989 or YEAR1990 as would normally be the case, with % @{PAR}
   meaning match on nothing. Note that this means that you must@{PAR}
   use '' to match an apostrophe.@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}


Note:  "Expression" in the above table means either a single character
(i.e. "#?"), or an alternation (i.e. "#(ab|cd|ef)"), or a character
class (i.e. "#[a-zA-Z]").@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE StaExtPrg "Tutorials/Starting External Programs"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}How we start external programs@{ub}@{PAR}

Directory Opus uses the small (4k) AmigaDOS program 'DOpusRT' to help
it launch AmigaDOS, WorkBench, Script and ARexx programs. When you
start up an external program a script file is created in the T:
directory. This script file contains all the initialisation and
execution code needed to start up and manage your programs.@{PAR}

The DOpuRT program is called at the end of the script file, and
communicates with Directory Opus to inform it when the script file has
finished running. This is needed for functions that are not run
asynchronously. It also doubles as a wait command, which is needed for
the adjustable close delay.@{PAR}

To take advantage of the current directory changing, adjustable stack,
and priority you will need the commands CD, Stack and Change TaskPri
in your computer's C:directory. You will also need the commands Run,
Execute, FailAt, NewCLI and EndCLI. These are almost always present
in your C: directory anyway (if not in ROM), so you should not need to
install them.@{PAR}

There are a couple of other points to be aware of. Because external
programs are run via a script file, they can be aborted like any other
script file by pressing CTRL-D. This is only possible if you have an
output window selected. If the script file is aborted in this fashion,
the output window effectively turns into a CLI, so you must type ENDCLI
to remove the window.@{PAR}

The second point is that if the program was not run asynchronously,
Directory Opus will be frozen, waiting for the signal back from the
DOpusRT program. If you abort the script file before it reaches
DOpusRT, Directory Opus will never unfreeze. You can force Directory
Opus to unfreeze by activating the Directory Opus window and pressing
SHIFT-ESC (the shift key in conjunction with the escape key). This also
allows you to turn any non-asynchronous program into an asynchronous
program, while the program is running.@{PAR}

Note that when using NewCLI or NewShell as the Output command, an error
such as unknown command will abort the script file as well. You should
therefore make sure that all your buttons, filetypes, hotkeys or menus
do not try to run nonexistent programs.@{PAR}

@ENDNODE
@NODE Glos "Tech Guide/Glossary"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Glossary@{ub}@{PAR}

Some terms used in this manual that you may need to know are:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

@{i}Active (directory window) @{ui}@{PAR}

Denoted by a highlighted disk name. This is the source
directory, the directory that all commands will act upon.@{PAR}

@{i}Buffers (directory) @{ui}@{PAR}

A Directory Buffer is an internal storage area for directory
information. Whenever Directory Opus reads directory
information from a disk, it stores the information in a
Directory Buffer. By storing the directory information in a
buffer, Directory Opus can avoid unnecessarily re-reading the
disk.@{PAR}

@{i}Click-M-Click @{ui}@{PAR}

This is a Directory Opus term. To click-m-click is to click
with the mouse button, move the mouse to another part of the
screen, and press the mouse button again, all with the
double-click time set from Preferences.@{PAR}

This is used for various tasks: @{" swapping " link 1.5.2} the content
of the two directory windows, @{" entering " link 1.5.3.entering} a sub-directory
by displaying it in the destination window and many more.@{PAR}

An alternative to Click-M-Click is Click-Drag-Release (see below).@{PAR}

@{i}Click-Drag-Release @{ui}@{PAR}

This is an alternative method to Click-M-Click (which requires less mouse pointer
gymnastics). Click and hold on an unselected entry. Then, without releasing the
left mouse button, press and release the right mouse button. Still holding the left
mouse button, move the mouse pointer to the other directory window. As you move the
mouse pointer, a copy of the selected entry will follow the mouse. Position the
mouse pointer over the inactive window and release the mouse button.@{PAR}

There's a variation of Click-Drag-Release for the sure handed mouse gymnast: Click
and hold on an unselected entry. Then, without releasing the left mouse button, move
the pointer to the unselected Directory Window and release the mouse button. The
trick to this method is to move the mouse pointer horizontally without moving up or
down.@{PAR}

Click-Drag-Release is only available if the appropriate @{" config setting " link 3.17.5} is
activated.@{PAR}

@{i}Directory Window @{ui}@{PAR}

One of the two windows on the screen in which entries are
displayed.@{PAR}

@{i}Double-click @{ui}@{PAR}

An Amiga term, this means to click twice with the mouse
button (usually the left button, but sometimes the right
button) on an object, within a pre-determined time. The time
is set from within Preferences, and you should consult your
Amiga manual for more information on this.@{PAR}

@{i}Drag'n Drop @{ui}@{PAR}

An Amiga Term. To Drag'n Drop is to click and hold an item with the left mouse button.
Then, without releasing the left mouse button, move the mouse pointer to an other part
of the screen. The item will follow the mouse pointer (you're "dragging" it). Position
the mouse pointer over another item and release the mouse button (now you're "dropping"
the item). DirOpus allowes you to @{" Drag'n Drop Workbench icons " link 1.10} onto its
window or its AppIcon.@{PAR}

@{i}Drive gadgets @{ui}@{PAR}

The 30 gadgets, of which only six are visible at once, that
enable you to easily read any directory.@{PAR}

@{i}Entry @{ui}@{PAR}

Either a file or a directory.@{PAR}

@{i}File types @{ui}@{PAR}

A file type is a set of user-defined tests to see whether a
file is of a certain type or not. Actions can then be
performed on the file, depending on its type.@{PAR}

@{i}Highlight @{ui}@{PAR}

Highlight is the term given to the changing or reversal of
colours, usually when an object is selected.@{PAR}

@{i}Inactive (directory window) @{ui}@{PAR}

Disk name is not highlighted. This is the destination
destination directory, and files may sometimes be written
here from the source directory.@{PAR}

@{i}Menu @{ui}@{PAR}

A pull-down menu is like a list of gadgets. A menu is
accessed by moving the mouse to the top of the screen and
holding the right mouse button.@{PAR}

@{i}Open @{ui}@{PAR}

A directory that currently displayed is said to be open.@{PAR}

@{i}Requester @{ui}@{PAR}

A requester is usually a box that appears on the screen,
soliciting a response. Some requesters require a string
input, others simply ask you to choose yes or no.@{PAR}

@{i}RMB Button @{ui}@{PAR}

A Directory Opus term. This is a button that is selected
with the right mouse button, not with the left mouse button.@{PAR}

@{i}Selected @{ui}@{PAR}

Entries are selected when they are highlighted. This is
usually done by clicking on them with the left mouse button.@{PAR}

@NODE faq "Frequently asked questions"
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Frequently Asked Questions@{ub}@{PAR}

@{FG highlight}1. Why do newer versions of DirOpus refuse to play music modules ?@{FG text}@{PAR}

DirOpus utilizes the inovamusic.library to play various sound/music @{" formats " link 1.6.play}.
This library is Copyright Inovatronics (the former publisher of DirOpus 4). We were not able to
get the rights to that library, as nobody knows the current whereabouts of the original author.@{PAR}

At the time of writing, you can download the Inovamusic.library from
http://www.amclust.de/software/archive/CanDoLibs.lha.@{PAR}

We recommend to use external players anyway, they're much more flexible and support much more
formats. Check Hippoplayer (mus/play/hippoplayer.lha), DeliTracker (mus/play/DeliTracker232.lha)
or EaglePlayer (mus/play/EaglePlayer201.lha, Shareware) for example.@{PAR}

@{FG highlight}2. DirOpus is slooow and my modem makes strange noises when running the program ?!@{FG text}@{PAR}

This only happens with beta releases. This is due to socalled "serial debug output" (the program
sends debugging information to the serial port). If you don't know how to handle this, don't download
beta versions, just stick with the public releases.@{PAR}

Note: Not all beta releases make serial debug output. *Always* read the notes on the homepage and
the "History" file included in the distribution to get informed about problems you might encounter
with a certain release.@{PAR}

If you still want to use beta versions, download "Sushi" or "Sashimi" from Aminet. Make sure
you read and understood the accompanying documentation and run one of those programs before
starting DirOpus.@{PAR}

@{FG highlight}3. But I use a modem to connect to the internet, can I still use beta releases ?@{FG text}@{PAR}

Yes. If you are using Sushi or Sashimi (see previous question), debug output will not
interfere with serial communication between your Amiga and the modem.@{PAR}

@{FG highlight}4. I'm using OS 3.9's XADmaster.library and depacking files will trash filenames !@{FG text}@{PAR}

This is a bug in the version of XADmaster.library distributed on the OS 3.9 CD. Please install
BoingBag 39-1 (available from Amiga Inc.'s homepage). This should cure the problem.@{PAR}

@{FG highlight}5. Support for XADmaster.library does not work !@{FG text}@{PAR}

Make sure the @{" FORCEOPENXAD " link 1.3.1} tooltype is set. If you've got any archive
filetypes defined, make sure their double-click and/or click-m-click actions are undefined.@{PAR}

@{FG highlight}6. When I try to start DOpus from CLI, a requester asks me to insert volume "DOpus:" !?@{FG text}@{PAR}

When starting DOpus from the CLI, you *must* switch to DOpus' directory first. Assuming The
programm can be found in "SYS:Tools/DirOpus", you would have to type the following:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

CD SYS:Tools/DirOpus@{PAR}
DirectoryOpus@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

If you don't like this, you can either reintroduce the "DOpus:" assign or spread DOpus'
files to various system directories on your boot partition (see next question).@{PAR}

@{FG highlight}7. With previous versions, I had my DOpus files spread around my HD. Is this still possible ?@{FG text}@{PAR}

No problem, as long as you know what you're doing. If DirOpus can't find its files
in its own directory, it will will search them in standard System directories:@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 4}

C:      DirectoryOpus, ConfigOpus, DOpusRT, all Modules@{PAR}
S:      Configuration files, helpfiles@{PAR}
LIBS:   Libraries@{PAR}
LOCALE: Catalog files@{PAR}
@{LINDENT 1}

Just copy the files from the Directory Opus distribution to the appropriate directories
and you can start DirOpus simply by typing 'DirectoryOpus' in the CLI.@{PAR}

@{FG highlight}8. I'd like to continue using the DOpus: Assign. Is this still possible ?@{FG text}@{PAR}

Yes. DirOpus still uses this assign (as a last option, if everything else fails) to find
its files.@{PAR}

@{FG Highlight}9. What is neccessary to start DirOpus when booting without Startup-Sequence ?@{FG text}@{PAR}

If your Computer is equipped with a MC 68060 Processor, you should first start setpatch (simply
type SETPATCH in the CLI), otherwise problems may occur (see next question).@{PAR}

@{FG highlight}10. Why is there no version of DirOpus compiled for a 68060 ?@{FG text}@{PAR}

Compiling the complete Directory Opus Package takes quite much time and there would be no speed
gain for 68060 users. The benefits simply wouldn't justify the efforts. The only drawback is
that SetPatch has to be started before DirOpus on a 68060 equipped Amiga.@{PAR}
