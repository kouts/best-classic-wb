@{B}C.         Program and Environment Settings@{UB}

Sections @{"1.14" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 1323}, @{"9.1" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 9} and @{"9.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 76} explain how to save program and environment
settings to a file. The format and function of the individual settings and
their associated file-keywords is described here.

All numbers may be expressed either in decimal or hexadecimal (preceded by
a "0x" prefix) notation. For example, "COLORS = 16" is equivalent to
"COLORS = 0x10". Each settings file may contain zero or more assignments.
In case of duplicate settings (i.e. if the same keyword appears more than
once in the same file), the last definition prevails. LONGMIN and LONGMAX
respectively indicate the minimum and maximum 32-bit number which is
handled (from several billions negative to several billions positive, i.e.
0x7FFFFFFF). Similarly, SHORTMIN = -32768 and SHORTMAX = 32767 (0x7FFF).


@{B}C.1        Program Settings@{UB}

Program settings are global to Personal Paint. Program settings which
appear in a settings file which is loaded are applied to all
environments.

Range: 0.. 3 (obtained by adding 1 for Tool Bar activation and 2 for the
Title Bar).


@{B}BKFTRANSP@{UB}  (Brush Backfill Transparency - Section @{"9.14.3" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 855})

0 = No, 1 = Yes.


@{B}BLITLIBS@{UB}  (Virtual Blitter library - Section @{"9.13.7" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 803})

BLITLIBS = @{I}"DefLibraryName", "AltLibraryName", UseDef@{UI}

DefLibraryName: Name of default library for blitting, usually employing
Amiga blitter and Chip RAM.

AltLibraryName: Name of alternate library for blitting, which uses the CPU
and/or a non-Amiga blitter, and might optionally replace functions of the
graphics library with custom functions in order to allow bitmaps to be
kept in Fast RAM.

UseDef: 0 = Use alternate library, 1 = Try to use default library.


@{B}CAVRESIZE@{UB}  (Color Average Resize - Section @{"9.13.3" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 734})

0 = No, 1 = Yes.


@{B}CREDUC@{UB}  (Color Reduction - Section @{"9.7" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 319})

0 = Qualitative, 1 = Quantitative.


@{B}CREMAP@{UB}  (Color remapping - Section @{"9.8" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 366})

0= Simple, 1 = Pattern Dithering, 2 = Floyd-Steinberg


@{B}FILREQ@{UB}  (File Requester Flags - Section @{"9.9" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 452})

Range: 0 .. 63. The individual values must be added: 1 = Expand Path, 2 =
Directories on Top, 4 = Sort by Date, 8 = Double-Click, 16 = Confirm
Overwriting and 32 = ASL (system) file requester.


@{B}FILTER@{UB}  (Image Processing Filters - Section @{"3.1.4" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0017/Main 521})

Format: @{I}FILTER = "Name", Type, <Kernel>, DivFac, Bias, BiasDX, BiasDY@{UI}

The quoted Name field may contain quote and backslash signs only if these
are preceded by a backslash sign ('\\').

Filter Types: 0 = Convolution, 1 = Popularity, 2 = Random, 3 = Dispersed
Dithering, 4 = Clustered Dithering, 5 = Floyd-Steinberg Dithering, 6 =
Environment Transparency, 7 = Brush Transparency, 8 = Stereogram.

Kernel: 5 blocks (rows of the convolution matrix) of 5 values each. Empty
fields must be set to 0. The range for each field is SHORTMIN ..
SHORTMAX.

DivFac (Division Factor) must be in the range SHORTMIN .. -1 or 1 ..
SHORTMAX for Convolution and 1 .. 3 for Dispersed and Clustered Dithering;
the value is ignored for the other filter types.

If the Type is Convolution, Bias, BiasDeltaX and BiasDeltaY are also
considered, and should be in the range SHORTMIN .. SHORTMAX. For the Brush
Transparency type, Bias values of -1 and -2 are used to respectively
indicate "Next Brush" and "Same Brush" alpha channel modes.

@{I}The following notes apply to the Stereogram Filter Type.@{UI}

A value of DivFac (Division Factor, range SHORTMIN .. SHORTMAX) greater
than zero generates SIRDS (random dot) stereograms and indicates how many
columns are to be created. This means that the pattern of random dots will
be as wide as the image width divided by DivFac. Values of zero or less
generate SIPS stereograms, which use the current brush as a pattern.

Bias (range 1 .. 16) allows the user to make some changes which affect the
perceived quality of the stereogram. Lower quality stereograms (low Bias
values) allow for more levels of depth, but may generate defects in
certain shapes (e.g. thick vertical bars may appear thin). Higher quality
images are easier to recognize, but their "flatness" (which is relative,
because the contrast is excellent) leaves less room for different levels
of depth.

BiasDx (range SHORTMIN .. SHORTMAX) is used as a Random Seed for SIRDS in
general and for SIPS with Echo suppression. Negative values cause a
different seed to be generated automatically each time the filter begins
processing. Values >= 0 allow for exact reproduction of SIRDS, as the
patter remains constant for each single value.

BiasDy controls different other options, which are associated to its
individual bits. The range is 0 .. 3, and the values must be added: 1 =
Help Symbols (on top of image), 2 = Echo Suppression.

UNDOLIM = @{I}MaxLevels, MaxBuffer@{UI}

MaxLevels range: 1 .. SHORTMAX (number of Undo/Redo levels).

MaxBuffer range: 1 .. LONGMAX (in bytes: 1 Mbyte = 1 048 576 bytes).

MaxBuffer indicates the maximum amount of memory (including virtual
memory) which can be used to store the Undo levels (up to a maximum of
MaxLevels Undo levels).

Once the maximum is reached, the oldest levels are progressively freed to
leave room for the most recent levels.

Whatever the settings, one level of undo and redo is always guaranteed
(even if it exceeds the memory limit set by the MaxBuffer setting).


@{B}USE15KHZ@{UB}  (15 kHz Video - Section @{"9.13.6" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 784})

@{"9.3.3" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 212})

WBCLOSE = @{I}Permission Status@{UI}

0 = Not allowed, 1 = Allowed.

In case of RAM shortage, and if allowed to do so, Personal Paint may
automatically try to close the Workbench screen to free some memory.


@{B}WBENCH@{UB}  (Workbench Screen - Section @{"9.15" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 863})

0 = Closed, 1 = Open.


@{B}C.2        Environment Settings@{UB}

Environment settings are local to the environment from which the settings
file is loaded (any program settings appearing in the same file are
applied to all environments).

0 = No, 1 = Yes.


@{B}COLORS@{UB}  (Number of Colors - Section @{"4.5.3" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 1015})

The number of screen and image colors must be valid for the current
DISPLAY setting. On Advanced Graphics Architecture systems, valid values
are: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256.


@{B}COORD@{UB}  (Coordinates - Section @{"9.6" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 303})

0 = None, 1 = Origin 0:0, 2 = Origin 1:1.


@{B}DISPLAY@{UB}  (Amiga DisplayID - Section @{"4.5" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 901})

This is the ID associated to the screen mode. Programmers may find the
relative assignments in "graphics/displayinfo.h" (1.@{I}x@{UI} and 2.@{I}x@{UI} @{I}include@{UI}
files) or in "graphics/modeid.h" (3.@{I}x@{UI} includes).

A value of 0xFFFFFFFF indicates to use the same screen mode as the
Workbench screen. This was designed with the program startup files in
mind. By default, Personal Paint is launched with the same screen mode as
the Workbench, which avoids monitor flickering in combination with
graphics boards.


@{B}IMAGEH@{UB}  (Image Height - Section @{"4.5.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 997})

This is the height of the current image (original blitter limit: 1024; ECS
and AA blitter: 32767).


@{B}IMAGEW@{UB}  (Image Width - Section @{"4.5.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 997})

This indicates the width of the current image, and may be larger than the
screen format. The maximum is defined by the Amiga blitter chip (1008
pixels on original chips, 32752 on ECS and AA chips).

@{B}SCREENH@{UB}  (Screen Height - Section @{"4.5.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 997})

Must range from 200 to the maximum overscan height. Negative numbers
select overscan height values in the same order as in SCREENW.


@{B}SCREENW@{UB}  (Screen Width - Section @{"4.5.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 997})

Indicates the screen width of the current environment. It must range from
320 (minimum) to the maximum system overscan width. Negative values
indicate system overscan widths: -1 = No overscan, -2 = Text, -3 =
Standard, -4 = Extreme and -5 = Maximum.


@{B}SNAPGRID@{UB}  (Grid Settings - Section @{"9.13.1" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 705})

SNAPGRID = @{I}XStep, YStep, XOffset, YOffset@{UI}

XStep YStep range: 1 .. SHORTMAX
XOffset YOffset range: 0 .. SHORTMAX



@{B}C.3        Read-Only Settings@{UB}

The following program settings are dedicated to the more technical users.
Personal Paint does not write these settings. They can only be inserted in
a file using a text editor or a word processor such as Personal Write.


@{B}ICONFMT@{UB}  (Icons - Section @{"9.10" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 538})

ICONFMT = @{I}MaxIconWidth, MaxIconHeight, UseMaxColors, DotIcons@{UI}

Width and Height: maximum value is 93 if used to create NewIcon icons.

UseMaxColors: 0 = Not allowed, 1 = Allowed.

DotIcons: 0 = Standard Icon, 1 = Single-Dot Icon

UseMaxColors is equivalent to the <Shift> key being pressed. The DotIcons
option is useful to limit the standard Workbench icon image to a single
pixel when NewIcons icons are generated.


@{B}REDBITS, GREENBITS, BLUEBITS@{UB}

REDBITS = @{I}RedBits@{UI}

GREENBITS = @{I}GreenBits@{UI}

BLUEBITS = @{I}BlueBits@{UI}

Range: 0 .. 8 (0 = Display Mode Default; All set to 8 = 24-bit palette)

This option forces Personal Paint to use a certain number of bits for each
color component in the color palette, regardless of the hardware being
used.

For example, to emulate the limitations of an Original Chip Set system on
an AGA computer, all three values should be set to 4. Conversely, in order
not to lose information when working with some common 12-bit or 18-bit
hardware (e.g. ECS systems, or Picasso graphics boards), all three values
should be set to 8.

Interesting image processing effects can be obtained by selecting low
values (e.g. 1 to emulate CMYK/RGBW devices).


@{B}THICKX, THICKY@{UB}

THICKX = @{I}HorizontalThickness@{UI}

THICKY = @{I}VerticalThickness@{UI}

These settings determine the horizontal and vertical thickness of most
user interface items (tools, borders, bars, etc.) A value of 0 indicates
dynamic thickness (i.e. selected by the program depending on the screen
size), 1 = single thickness, 2 = double-thickness, 3 =
quadruple-thickness, and so on. In practice, manual thickness setting
never causes objects to appear larger than they would with the option set
to 0. Otherwise, some requesters would not fit on the screen.

Range: 0 .. 128.
