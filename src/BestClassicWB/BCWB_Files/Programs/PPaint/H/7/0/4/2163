@{B}D.         Selection of Amiga Printer Drivers@{UB}

The following is a partial list of printers and some of the printer
drivers which can be used in combination with those printers. Many drivers
have been updated several times through the different versions of the
Amiga operating system. Where the standard printer drivers provided with
the Amiga operating system are not sufficient, at Cloanto we recommend
alternate systems such as Studio and TurboPrint. Section @{"11.3" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0046/Main 130} has more
information on printers.

@{B}Notes:@{UB}

(1) For Epson 24/48-pin printers and compatibles (360 by 360 dpi
graphics). Compatible printers must be set in the Epson LQ or ESC/P2
emulation mode. Also works well in text mode on 8/9-pin printers.

(2) For Epson 8/9-pin printers and compatibles. Compatible printers must
be set in the Epson X emulation mode. Better results in both text and
graphics mode may be obtained using the EpsonXOld driver. The EpsonQ
driver should be used for 24-pin printers.

(3) For NEC Pinwriter 24-pin printers and compatibles. Compatible printers
must be set in the NEC Pinwriter emulation mode.

(4) The IBM interface module is required.

(5) Drives all Toshiba P351 C and compatibles.

(6) Drives all Toshiba P351 SX and compatibles.

(7) The Centronics option is required.

(8) The printer must be in IBM mode to use the CBM_MPS1000 driver. Some
functions may not be activated.

(9) To use the EpsonX driver, the printer must be in Epson mode. Some
features may not be supported. Note (2) also applies.

(10) The CalComp_ColorMaster driver should be used on systems with less
than 1 Mbyte of RAM. The CalComp_ColorMaster2 driver is faster, but uses
more memory. Both drivers also work with the CalComp ColorView printer.

(11) The Seiko_5300a driver is also available. The Seiko_5300a is faster
than the standard Seiko_5300, but it requires more memory. Note (12) also
applies.

(12) These drivers are not included on the Workbench and Extras disks.
They may be available from the printer manufacturer, in Amiga disk
collections (e.g. Fish Disk) and electronic networks (e.g.
Internet/Aminet, CompuServe, BIX).

(13) New drivers introduced with version 2.1 of the Amiga operating
system.

(14) Tests have shown that 9-pin Epson drivers may yield better printouts
than IBM and EpsonQ drivers even on 24-pin printers. Note 9 may also
apply.

(15) The improved @{I}Print Manager@{UI} Amiga drivers are available from Citizen.
Note 3 also applies.

(16) The PostScript driver is activated directly in Personal Paint
(regardless of the Amiga printer driver) by selecting the PS Mode in the
first print requester (section @{"4.3" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 201}).

(17) New drivers developed by Commodore and Cloanto.
