@{B}A.         Program Messages@{UB}

This appendix lists (in alphabetical order) and explains the most
important messages of Personal Paint. A more complete description can be
found in the referenced sections.

If the message is displayed in a requester containing only the Proceed,
Cancel or OK gadgets, the <Return> key can be used instead of the OK or
Proceed gadget, while <Esc> can be pressed instead of selecting the Cancel
gadget. Sections @{"1.10.12" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 984} ("The <Return> key") and @{"1.10.16" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 1029} ("The <Esc>
key") have more on the topic.


@{B}All rights reserved - Unauthorized reproduction or transfer is illegal@{UB}

This message has to be displayed for strictly legal reasons. More in
Appendix F.


@{B}Animation is not possible: image larger than screen@{UB}

As explained in the introduction to animation, the animation frame format
cannot exceed the screen limits. It may be possible to open a larger
screen by choosing a different screen mode, or by activating an overscan
mode or by enabling autoscroll.


@{B}Animations cannot be loaded as anim-brushes@{UB}
@{B}Anim-Brushes cannot be loaded as animations@{UB}

Amiga anim-brushes use a standard file format (described in section
@{"6.8.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/2151/Main 370}), which is different from the formats normally used by animations.
Furthermore, anim-brushes can be of sizes which are incompatible with the
screen modes required to display animations. These differences make it
difficult to directly process anim-brushes by animation functions, and
vice versa. Personal Paint offers conversion options between the two
formats through ARexx scripts. Anim-brushes can be easily copied from the
current animation by clicking three times on the Define Brush tool
(section @{"3.1.6" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0017/Main 1027}).


@{B}Animations cannot be merged@{UB}

The Color Merge functions only handle images - not animations.


@{B}Another program is using the file@{UB}

The operation on the specified file cannot be performed because the file
is currently being locked by another process. This can happen, for
example, if another program is writing to the same picture file which
Personal Paint is trying to load.


@{B}Audio cannot be activated@{UB}

Personal Paint cannot start the CloantoAudio module, after searching for
it in the "DEVS" logical volume and in the drawer (or volume) from where
Personal Paint was loaded. By default, the "DEVS" logical volume is
assigned to the "Devs" drawer of the boot disk (which may be the Workbench
disk containing Personal Paint). It may also be that the CloantoAudio file
was found, but the CloantoAudio module could not reply in time (handshake
function) because it was slowed down by another disk operation, or because
there was not enough memory. Personal Paint tries to load the audio module
if there is enough memory to do so, and no other Cloanto program has
already loaded CloantoAudio. The same CloantoAudio module can serve an
unlimited number of Cloanto programs, thus overcoming the limitations set
by the Amiga on the maximum number of open audio channels. If the
CloantoAudio module is started manually (e.g. by selecting its icon), it
remains RAM-resident until the computer is reset or switched off, and does
not need to be loaded every time from its client programs. Sections @{"1.11" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 1074}
and @{"1.13" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 1258}.


@{B}Bad IFF structure@{UB}

The file read by Personal Paint is recognized as being in IFF format, but
its content does not keep to the rules defined for the IFF standard. Some
programs do not use the IFF format correctly.


@{B}Brush ... will be lost@{UB}

This warning message is displayed before Free Brush is executed (section
@{"5.7" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0048/Main 144}). If the operation is confirmed, it will not be possible to recover
the brush with Restore Brush.


@{B}Brush frames will be lost@{UB}

The current brush is an anim-brush consisting of more than one frame. The
anim-brush has not been saved. The selected command would cause the loss
of all frames except for the current one.


@{B}Brush size is ..., ... planes
Used size is ..., ... planes@{UB}

This information is provided by the Chop Information function. More in
section @{"5.13" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0048/Main 492}.


@{B}Clipboard device cannot be opened@{UB}

The Amiga public clipboard cannot be opened. The "clipboard.device" file
in the "DEVS" logical unit probably cannot be loaded. Personal Paint tries
to open the Clipboard (if it is not already open) whenever this is
required by a program function.


@{B}Clipboard does not contain the required data@{UB}

A function which should read data from the clipboard has been used (e.g.
brush data), but the clipboard is empty, or only contains a different type
of data (for example, digitized audio) than what was expected. Sections
@{"5.10" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0048/Main 307} and @{"7.1" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0001/Main 10}.


@{B}Clipboard write error@{UB}

In most cases, this message indicates that there is not enough memory (RAM
or disk) for the Amiga operating system to store the specified clipboard
data. Sections @{"5.10.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0048/Main 337} and @{"11.1" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0046/Main 9}.


@{B}Data compression algorithm not identified@{UB}

Graphical data can occupy more memory than one would believe. Different
techniques exist to @{I}compress@{UI} this data, so that it occupies less space
than it would otherwise. Personal Paint uses and recognizes different
standard image compression techniques in the different file formats it
uses (IFF-ILBM, GIF, PCX, etc.) Another program may write some data using
a compression method (or @{I}algorithm@{UI}) not recognized by Personal Paint. When
Personal Paint tries to load this data, it displays this message. This
means that the data cannot be loaded by Personal Paint unless it is saved
in another format.


@{B}Decryption impossible@{UB}

An incorrect encryption key has been used to load an encrypted picture. An
encrypted image can only be loaded if the same key used to save the data
is also used to load it. This message can also appear if the disk is
damaged or the picture file has been modified by another program, though
this is very unlikely. Sections @{"4.1" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 11}, @{"4.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 135} and @{"9.4" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 225}.


@{B}Disk incompatible@{UB}

The format of the disk in the specified drive is not recognized by the
operating system. The disk may be damaged, not formatted or be in a format
not recognized by AmigaDOS. Sections @{"1.3.4" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 189}, @{"4.1" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 11} and @{"11.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0046/Main 51}.


@{B}Disk is not mounted@{UB}

The specified disk is not inserted in any drive. Section @{"11.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0046/Main 51}.


@{B}Disk is write-protected@{UB}

Data cannot be written on a disk which is write-protected. The hole at the
corner of the disk must be covered by the write-protect tab. Section
@{"11.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0046/Main 51}.


@{B}Disk not validated@{UB}

The Amiga operating system has not yet validated the disk. The operation
may have failed, or still be in progress, if the disk has just been
inserted. If the disk is not successfully validated ("Disk not validated"
system message), no new data can be written to the disk, which can be read
normally. Section @{"11.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0046/Main 51}.


@{B}Display Mode Selection@{UB}
@{B}Selected image...
Current mode... - ... colors@{UB}

The picture selected for a load operation has the same size as the current
image format. However, the selected file would require a different video
mode from the current one (as indicated in the video mode information
contained in the IFF-ILBM file, or calculated by Personal Paint if there
is no such information). This requester allows the user to decide whether
to maintain the current screen mode or to adopt the new one. Section
@{"4.1" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 11}.


@{B}Error during file I/O@{UB}

Personal Paint has several detailed error messages which are used if an
error occurs during a read or write operation. The Amiga operating system
may issue error codes which Personal Paint cannot translate into messages
indicating the exact cause of the error. If this happens during a file
read/write operation, this message is displayed.


@{B}Error during printer output@{UB}

An error is signalled by the Amiga operating system while data is being
sent to the printer. The most likely causes are: printer is switched off
or is in the off-line (deselected) state; printer is out of paper or the
paper is jammed; the printer's cover is open; the printer cable is not
connected properly; the wrong port (serial vs. parallel) was selected in
the Amiga Printer Preferences. Sections @{"4.3" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 201} and @{"11.3" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0046/Main 130}.


@{B}Error in file structure@{UB}

Personal Paint recognized the file format and began processing the file,
but at some point the data was inconsistent with the format specification.
For example, this could indicate improper use of pad bytes in an IFF
file.


@{B}Error opening diskfont.library version 34
Error opening icon.library version 33@{UB}

The specified library does not exist, or its version number is lower than
the one required.


@{B}Error: The keys are different@{UB}

Personal Paint requires the encryption key to be written twice. This
message is displayed if the first key and the control key are different.
This additional control is useful to prevent an image stored using an
incorrectly typed key from not being loaded any more. Section @{"9.4" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 225}.


@{B}File is protected from deletion@{UB}
@{B}File is protected from reading@{UB}
@{B}File is write-protected@{UB}

The specified file has a software protection which prevents the operating
system from removing, reading or modifying it. The Workbench Information
(or Info) or the Shell/CLI Protect command can be used to modify the
access status of the file.


@{B}Format Selection@{UB}
@{B}Requested format...
Current format... - ... colors@{UB}
@{B}Selected image...
Current format... - ... colors@{UB}

The current image format (i.e. size and/or number of colors) would be
changed as specified in the Image Format requester or in an IFF-ILBM or
settings file. When an image file is loaded, this requester allows the
user to choose between the new and the current format. The Stretch option
can be set to resize the image, if necessary. Color reduction is always
applied automatically when needed. Sections @{"4.1" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 11}, @{"4.5" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 901}, @{"9.7" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 319}, @{"9.8" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 366} and
@{"9.13.3" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 734}.


@{B}... frames out of ... would be stripped@{UB}

The Strip Frames function indicates how many frames would be removed, and
asks for confirmation, before actually doing so.


@{B}Image data is incomplete@{UB}

Personal Paint can now load incomplete or corrupt image files.


@{B}Icons cannot be loaded@{UB}

The "PPaint_Icons" drawer cannot be found, or it does not contain the
correct default icon files. Sections @{"1.14" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 1323} and @{"9.10.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 572}.


@{B}Incorrect version of Personal.font@{UB}

This message usually appears only when a new version of Personal Paint is
run for the first time. It indicates that the program, searching for its
user interface font (named "Personal"), found an incorrect (probably
older) version of the font. Normally, Personal Paint searches for the font
inside the "PPaint:fonts" drawer (first choice) and in the system FONTS:
directory (second choice). Any old "Personal.font" files stored in these
directories are normally updated automatically by the installation
procedure. The same should be done in case of manual installation. If
different versions of Personal Paint or the Personal Fonts Maker need to
be used on the same computer, and these programs require different
versions of the Personal font, then the "Personal.font" file should be
removed from the system FONTS: directory.

This message may also be displayed if a correct version of "Personal.font"
has been installed, but the old Personal font is still in use by the
system or by an application. If this is the case, executing the "Avail
FLUSH" command from a Shell window or rebooting the system should solve
the problem.

Section @{"10.4" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0015/Main 76} has more on the Personal font.


@{B}Incorrect version of the user interface texts@{UB}

It is likely that the program has not been installed properly, since it
has found a user interface file belonging to a different program version.
This may happen, for example, when testing a new version of the program
which has not yet been installed (but another version of the program is
installed).


@{B}I/O libraries not found@{UB}

This error message indicates that Personal Paint was unable to locate and
load its input/output libraries (used to load and save files), which are
normally stored in the "libs" directory placed in the same drawer of the
program file. This could be caused by improper installation. PPaint
normally searches for these files both in the local directory and in the
system "libs" directory, and uses the newest libraries which are
available.


@{B}Insufficient Chip memory for the requested screen@{UB}
@{B}Insufficient Chip memory to display window@{UB}

There is not enough Chip RAM to open a screen, window or requester.
Sections @{"1.3.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 89} and @{"11.1" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0046/Main 9}.


@{B}Invalid data@{UB}

This general purpose message is used if extremely unusual circumstances
are encountered. This may happen, for example, when attempting to load an
image whose size is 0 by 0.


@{B}Invalid number of colors for the requested screen@{UB}

In most cases, this indicates that the hardware being used does not
support as many colors as specified in the picture or settings file being
loaded. Probably, a particular screen mode was requested in an IFF-ILBM
file written on a computer supporting the same video mode, but with more
colors. Personal Paint automatically selects a different video mode as
close as possible to the requested number of colors.


@{B}Invalid parameter in line...@{UB}

An error has been encountered in loading a settings file. One or more
parameters of an instruction in the specified line have been found to
contain a value out of the valid range. Sections @{"9.1" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 9}, @{"9.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 76} and Appendix
@{"C" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0044/Main 1}.


@{B}Invalid window size@{UB}

To contain the required text elements, a window would become larger than
the screen. This may happen if requester texts in a "UIText" file are
edited without considering space limitations in lower resolution video
modes. Sections @{"1.14" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 1323} and @{"9.11" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 636}.


@{B}Line too long...@{UB}

An error has been encountered in loading a settings file. The line whose
position from the top of the file is indicated is too long (i.e. it
contains too many characters). Sections @{"9.1" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 9}, @{"9.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 76} and Appendix @{"C" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0044/Main 1}.


@{B}Memory save mode@{UB}

This message indicates that Personal Paint has detected a low-memory
environment and has taken action to reduce the occupation of RAM. This
mode can also be activated by holding the <F1> key down while the program
is starting. If possible, the program does the following things: the audio
functions are not used (the CloantoAudio module is not loaded); the
Workbench screen is closed; the printer driver is not pre-loaded at the
start of the program, and is removed from RAM (expunged) immediately after
each print operation; the directory lists of the file requester are not
stored to speed up the re-display of the same lists. Sections @{"9.15" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 863} and
@{"11.1" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0046/Main 9}.


@{B}No frames to strip@{UB}

The Strip Frames function has not found any duplicate frames.


@{B}No memory for undo@{UB}

The Storyboard would not be able to undo the selected operation. If the
operation is confirmed, the Undo and Cancel functions will be disabled.


@{B}No monitor information for the requested screen mode@{UB}

An IFF-ILBM file contains a reference to a video mode which is not
supported by the system hardware or operating system. (Most other file
formats do not contain explicit video mode information.) It may happen
that a given monitor, theoretically supported by the system, was not
activated as indicated in section @{"11.4" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0046/Main 303}.


@{B}Object too large@{UB}

An internal Amiga error has occurred. The data found is too large to be
handled by the operating system.


@{B}Operation impossible@{UB}

A function of the Amiga operating system has returned an error, but the
cause of the failure is not specified. Personal Paint cannot complete the
operation.


@{B}Path incorrect@{UB}

The path (i.e. the set of names of drawers, separated by '/' signs) which
is written in the file requester, does not exist in the requested unit.
One or more of the drawer names are incorrect or too long (maximum 25
characters). Some characters cannot be used in the names of files and
drawers. Sections @{"1.4" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 236}, @{"1.5" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 280} and @{"3.4" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0017/Main 1252}.

Virtual Memory uses this message to indicate that the given path could not
be accessed. Personal Paint attempts to create the last directory of the
path (usually the "t" directory), but the rest of the path name must refer
to existing devices and drawers.


@{B}Path too long@{UB}

The selected path contains too many levels (i.e. drawers within drawers),
which AmigaDOS cannot handle.


@{B}Personal.font cannot be opened@{UB}

Personal Paint uses a custom font, which contains symbols especially
designed for the program, for its user interface texts. On startup,
Personal Paint searches for the font in the "FONTS" logical volume or in
"PPaint:Fonts". Section @{"1.13" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 1258}.


@{B}PostScript module cannot be opened@{UB}

The "PPaint_PS" file cannot be loaded by Personal Paint. The program needs
to access this external module to output in PostScript mode. Sections
@{"1.13" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 1258} and @{"4.3.3" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 588}.


@{B}Printer device cannot be opened@{UB}

Personal Paint cannot activate the printer driver to execute a printing
operation. This may happen if there is not enough RAM available, or if the
"printer.device" file cannot be accessed in the "Printers" drawer in the
"DEVS" logical unit. Sections @{"1.11" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 1074}, @{"1.13" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 1258} and @{"11.3" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0046/Main 130}.


@{B}Printing copy ... of ...@{UB}

An image or a brush is being printed. The progress indication gives
detailed information on the data which the Amiga printer device has
already sent to the printer, and the amount still to be transmitted.
Sections @{"4.3" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 201}, @{"5.3" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0048/Main 85} and @{"11.3" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0046/Main 130}.


@{B}Stencil size does not match@{UB}

The operation requested would have required the stencil to be exactly as
wide and as tall as the image over which the stencil would have to be
applied. Section @{"8.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0016/Main 301} and subsections.


@{B}Studio server cannot be activated@{UB}

The Studio Print mode was selected for printing, but the Studio Server
software could not be activated. Most likely, the Studio software was not
installed properly, or it is an older version of the software. The Studio
Print Server software is supported from version 2 of the Studio and
CanonStudio packages. Previous releases of Studio printer drivers can be
accessed by selecting Personal Paint's "PRT" (System printer) print mode.
In this case, it may be preferable to (also) activate Personal Paint's own
24-bit printing routines (section @{"4.3.2.4" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 423}).


@{B}Syntax error in line...@{UB}

An error has been found in a settings file. In the specified line, a
keyword has not been recognized, or a command parameter is missing or
appears in an incorrect format. Section @{"9.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 76} and Appendix @{"C" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0044/Main 1}.


@{B}The animation can be viewed using "Play File"@{UB}

Some animation formats (e.g. some rare HAM and HAM8 files) cannot be
loaded and edited by Personal Paint, but only played from file.


@{B}The animation has been modified@{UB}

The animation has been modified, but not saved yet. By proceeding with the
operation requested, it would be lost.


@{B}The animation will be lost@{UB}

Proceeding with the selected command would imply deleting the current
animation.


@{B}The current font has no palette@{UB}

The Copy Font Palette command has been executed, but the current font does
not have an associated color palette. Sections @{"3.1.3.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0017/Main 398} and @{"8.1.8" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0016/Main 281}.


@{B}The current one is the only brush@{UB}

The Next Transparency command (which copies the transparency information
of another brush to the current brush) failed because there is no other
brush. Section @{"5.9.7" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0048/Main 279}.


@{B}The drawer is not empty@{UB}

Delete was used to remove a non-empty directory.


@{B}The filter requires a brush@{UB}

Some image processing filters use the current brush to apply certain
transformations to the image. This message appears if no brush has been
defined.


@{B}The filter requires an additional brush@{UB}

Image processing effects such as Alpha Channel require two consecutive
brushes.


@{B}The file does not contain the required data@{UB}

A file has been selected for a read operation, but the data contained in
that file is not of the expected type, or the content of the file has been
damaged. This can happen, for example, if Personal Paint tries to load a
settings file, but discovers that the file specified through the file
requester contains a brush image. In order to reduce the risk of similar
errors, files of different types should not be stored in the same drawer.
It is also advisable to append standard @{I}suffixes@{UI} to file names. Sections
@{"1.4" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 236} and @{"1.11" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 1074}.


@{B}The file does not exist@{UB}

A file has been specified for a load operation, but Personal Paint cannot
find a file with the given name following the specified path. Section @{"3.4" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0017/Main 1252}
("The File Requester") explains how to avoid the risk of mistyping file
and directory names.


@{B}The file exists and would be overwritten@{UB}

An operation which would overwrite an existing file has been selected. The
Confirm Overwriting option is active (section @{"9.9.6" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 525}), so the program
displays this warning message, indicating the file whose content would be
overwritten. The operation is aborted if the Cancel gadget of the
requester containing the message is selected. This makes it possible to
execute the operation again, using a different file name.


@{B}The file will be deleted@{UB}

The Delete File command has been executed. The operation is aborted if the
Cancel gadget of the requester containing the message is selected.


@{B}The filter requires two environments@{UB}

Stereograms and other effects require two environments (i.e. two images).
The filters apply the changes to the current environment, using the other
environment as a source.


@{B}The font cannot be opened@{UB}

The Font Requester has failed to load the specified font. This may happen
if an incorrect typeface name is typed, or if the available memory
conditions or a read/write error interrupt the font load operation.
Section @{"3.1.3.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0017/Main 398}.


@{B}The image has been modified@{UB}

The current image has been changed since it was last saved or defined. A
command has been executed which would cause the loss of the current image
(e.g. a Load Image or Quit command).


@{B}The image is too large@{UB}

The maximum image size supported by Personal Paint is limited by the Amiga
hardware. The original Amiga blitter could not handle images larger than
1008 by 1024 pixels. ECS and AA chips can process images as large as 32752
by 32767 pixels.


@{B}The image will be cut@{UB}

An image format smaller than the format of the image currently displayed
(or being loaded) has been selected. Unless the Stretch option of the
Format Selection requester is enabled, this additional warning requester
appears. Sections @{"4.1" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 11} and @{"4.5" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 901}.


@{B}The other image has been modified@{UB}

A Copy to Other command has been executed, but the image in the other
environment has not yet been saved since it was last modified. Proceeding
with the command would cause the other image to be lost. Section @{"4.8.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 1105}.


@{B}There is not enough memory@{UB}
@{B}There is not enough memory to load the user interface texts@{UB}

There is not enough memory to perform the operation requested. Sections
@{"1.3.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 89} and @{"11.1" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0046/Main 9}.


@{B}The requested display mode does not support double-buffering@{UB}

The specified display mode does not support double-buffering. The
introduction to chapter 6 ("Animation") explains this in more detail. This
warning message is displayed only once during each session with a given
screen mode.


@{B}The requested screen cannot be used@{UB}
@{B}The requested screen mode requires 2.x O.S. or higher@{UB}
@{B}The requested screen mode requires ECS or higher@{UB}

The IFF-ILBM file specified for loading an image also contains a reference
to a screen mode to be used. Due to hardware or operating system
limitations on the machine used to load the image, another screen mode has
to be used by Personal Paint. Sections @{"4.1" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 11} and @{"11.4" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0046/Main 303}.


@{B}The screen is not available any more@{UB}

A screen selected in the Grab Screen requester was closed before it could
be grabbed. Section @{"4.4" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0049/Main 870}.


@{B}The selected image type cannot be loaded@{UB}

The selected picture file uses an image encoding format not supported by
Personal Paint. These may include unusual IFF formats and image formats
which could not be edited with the freedom and precision required by
Personal Paint (e.g. Dual-Playfield images).


@{B}The size of the following brush does not match@{UB}

The Next Transparency command cannot apply the transparency information of
the following brush to the current one, because the two have different
sizes. Section @{"5.9.7" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0048/Main 279}.


@{B}The Undo buffer will be freed@{UB}

An explicit request to release the Undo buffer has been made (e.g. by
selecting the Undo tool with the right mouse button), or there is not
enough memory to allocate an Undo buffer for the selected operation. If
there is not enough memory to display this message, the buffer is freed
without displaying this request for confirmation. Sections @{"3.1.10" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0017/Main 1137} and
@{"11.1" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0046/Main 9}.


@{B}The ... user interface text should be shortened
The ... user interface text should be made splittable@{UB}

The "UIText" file for the specified language was loaded successfully, but
some texts were found to be too long to be displayed properly in some
video modes. A text can be made splittable by inserting an underscore
character ('_') where Personal Paint may go to a new line if there is not
enough horizontal space. Some texts (e.g. non-"TMS" texts) can only be
displayed in a single line. If these are too long, they must be shortened.
Sections @{"1.14" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 1323} and @{"9.11" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 636}.


@{B}The user interface text file cannot be opened@{UB}

The "UIText" file associated to the user interface language which is to be
loaded cannot be found. Personal Paint searches for the files in the
"PPaint_Prefs" drawer of either the "PPaint" volume, or the current
drawer. Sections @{"1.14" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 1323} and @{"9.11" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 636}.


@{B}Title not correct@{UB}

A wrong path has been specified for a file read or write function, or the
selected file name is not correct. Sections @{"1.4" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 236}, @{"1.5" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 280} and @{"3.4" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0017/Main 1252}.


@{B}UIGraphics.pic cannot be loaded@{UB}

The file containing the images used in Personal Paint's user interface
could not be loaded. Possible causes include: file not found, insufficient
memory, file corrupt. When editing the image, it is important that the
reference lines used to the delimit the areas in the picture be respected
and not modified. Section @{"1.14" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 1323}.


@{B}UIText: Error in line...@{UB}

A syntax error has been found in a "UIText" user interface file. For
example, a keyboard shortcut was not enclosed in a couple of '<' and '>'
signs, or an unrecognized keyboard qualifier name was used. A line number
greater than the number of lines in the file indicates that one or more
texts are missing. Sections @{"1.14" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 1323} and @{"9.11" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 636}.


@{B}Virtual memory settings cannot be changed@{UB}

There is not enough storage space to move the virtual memory objects which
are currently in use. The changes to the virtual memory settings are
cancelled.


@{B}Virtual memory storage limit exceeded@{UB}

This warning message indicates that one or both storage devices used for
virtual memory already have less free space than the user-requested
minimum. This may happen after changing a virtual memory storage device,
or after increasing the minimum values.


@{B}Volume is full@{UB}

The unit to which a save operation has been directed is full, and cannot
contain the requested amount of data. The data can still be saved on any
unit which has enough free room to contain it. The disks which come with
Personal Paint are almost completely full. Additional data (e.g. a
picture) should not be saved to these disks. Instead, a new disk should be
formatted, or a new drawer should be created on a hard disk partition
where some space is left, to contain all Personal Paint files. Sections
@{"1.3.4" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 189}, @{"1.5" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 280}, @{"1.13" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0002/Main 1258} and @{"11.2" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0046/Main 51}.


@{B}Volume not mounted@{UB}

The selected peripheral does not contain any storage unit. There probably
is no disk in the selected drive. This can only happen if the Expand Path
option has been disabled, as Personal Paint's default volume access mode
is by logical name, rather than physical name. Section @{"9.9.1" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 460}.


@{B}Workbench screen cannot be closed@{UB}

Personal Paint cannot close the Workbench screen, since it contains other
windows than those used to display the content of disks and drawers.
Section @{"9.15" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 863}.


@{B}Workbench screen cannot be opened@{UB}

Personal Paint cannot open the Workbench screen, as requested in a
settings file or through a program menu. There is probably not enough free
Chip RAM. Sections @{"9.15" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0047/Main 863} and @{"11.1" LINK PPaintCD:H/7/0/4/0046/Main 9}.
