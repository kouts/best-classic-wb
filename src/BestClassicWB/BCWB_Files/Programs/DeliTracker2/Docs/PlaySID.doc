PRODUCT INFO:

	This is a utility which uses the playsid.library to emulate the SID
	and 6510 chip. The SID chip is the component in the C64 computer that
	handles sound. The 6510 chip is the CPU of the C64, that means the
	component that actually executes all programs. Because the Amiga
	does not have these chips and others, you can't run C64 programs
	directly on Amiga.

	Now this utility lets you play all those C64 programs that produce
	sound. As you probably know, the C64 has three sound channels (the
	amiga has four). But this utility also allows use of the fourth
	channel. This channel is the product of some special programming on
	the C64, it isn't really a channel.

	The purpose of this product is to make the best conversion of C64
	sound on Amiga ever possible. If you think some sound isn't correctly
	converted please let us know.

	This utility is designed to work with true multitasking, under any
	system version and any amiga model. It can be run from both Workbench
	and CLI/Shell. It should work with any other program that don't use
	sound or timing. If this isn't the fact please let us know.

	Some time ago we released a similar product called "The 100 most
	remembered C64 game-tunes". This product is the version 3.0 of that
	program. The tunes on that demonstration disk are now also available
	to this version. And up to date there are more than 400 tunes
	available. We and others are also working with more.


PLAYSID LIBRARY

	The playsid.library is a standard amiga library	where all the C64
	music emulation is done. You can now add support for PlaySID modules
	in your own programs!! REMEMBER that you still need to supply the
	whole PlaySID archive with your program and CAN NOT only extract the
	library. Read the library documentation for more information.


PROGRAM INSTALLATION:

	From v3.0 and on PlaySID uses a library called "playsid.library".
	This file should be in your LIBS: directory.

	To use this utility from Workbench you could assign SID: to a 
	directory containing PlaySID. Then all you have to do is to double
	click on the icon of the tune you want to play. You could also just
	select the icon of the tune, then press the shift key and hold it
	down while double clicking on the PlaySID icon.

	If you want to run this utility from CLI/Shell, just put the
	directory containing PlaySID in your path (e.g. c: ) and then write:
	PlaySID [<tune directory>/<tune name>]


STARTUP PARAMETERS

	WORKBENCH:

	From Workbech PlaySID uses startup parameters in in its icon
	tooltypes.

		CX_POPUP = <Yes|No>

	Use "Yes" if you want the PlaySID windows showable at the startup. A
	"No" means all windows will be hidden instead. Default is "Yes".

		CX_POPKEY = <key>

	The key combination is used as a HotKey for the PlaySID main window.
	Default	key is "Ctrl Shift P".

		CX_PRORITY = <pri>

	This sets the priority of the commodity engine in PlaySID. Default
	value is zero. IF you do not know what this parameter is used for,
	please leave it then.

	SHELL/CLI:

	From Shell or CLI you can supply extra parameters after the PlaySID
	command.

		CX_POPUP, CX_POPKEY and CX_PRIORITY

	Same as above tooltypes parameters.

		FILES = <list>

	A list of the files to play. The first one is loaded at startup. As
	default	no file is loaded and played.
	

PROGRAM USAGE:

	It works almost like an ordinary cassette player, with the symbols
	for play, forward, rewind, pause and stop. While PlaySID is active
	you can just drag a tune icon and drop it on the PlaySID window. To
	most commands there are keyboard shortcuts.

	l - Play
	a - Pause
	s - Stop
	t - Next Tune
	T - Previous Tune
	o - Open
	p - Previus module
	n - Next module

	The menu have more options like about, open, quit, filter, rewind
	and display. The filter option turns on and off the amiga sound 
	filter. Please try it.


REWIND BUTTON:

	If the rewind option is turned on, the rewind gadget will be enabled
	first when you press the play gadget. The rewind routines are very
	complex and need a lot of memory. Thats the reason of the option. It
	takes approximately 30k every minute of playing.


REAL-TIME DISPLAY:

	From version 3.0 of PlaySID and on, a special window with real-time
	information about envelopes and waveforms is included. To enable the
	window, use the display option in the menu.


SHOW C64 PICTURES:

	This option opens a screen with a C64 Picture. The first 2 bytes is
	the loading address and is ignored by PlaySID. Then follows a 8000
	bytes bitmap and a 1000 bytes	charmap. For multicolor	pictures
	there is also a 1000 bytes colormap and 1 byte holding the background
	color. The order and base addresses is depending on the file format.

	PlaySID have support for the following formats:

	HIRES		Art Studio
			Image System
			Doodle

	MULTICOLOR	Koala
			Advanced Art Studio
			Vidcom 64
			Image System
			Blazing Paddles


XPK AND POWERPACKER SUPPORT:

	Version 2.2 of PlaySID and above support powerpacked files. V3.0 and
	above also support the XPK Compression libraries. If PlaySID finds
	XPK or Powerpacker installed all file loading is done with it. To
	save space you can now crunch all your files, e.g. songs and 
	pictures.


ONE-FILE FORMAT:

	Many users requested a new "one file" format of PlaySID data files.
	The file SIDConv on the disk will convert a regular data/icon file
	to the new one-file format or the opposite. Of course these new
	files can be crunched as well.

	SIDConv iconfile newfile	- To convert a data/icon file to the
					  "one file" format.

	SIDConv	one-filefile newfile ICON
					- To convert a file in "one file"
					  format to the regular data/icon
					  file.


AREXX PORT:

	PlaySID have an Arexx Port named 'PLAYSID'. This mean that you now
	have full controll of PlaySID through your arexx scripts. Supplied
	with this release are two examples of what you can do with arexx:

	Jukebox - This will take given file as input and play each
		  module the amount of time given.

		  Try: RX Jukebox JukeDemo

	Preview - This will play each tune in given module for 10 sec.
		  Like the preview found in CD Players.

		  Try: RX Preview Songs/RunTheGauntlet

	Arexx commands supported:

	SID_PLAY()	  - Start current tune
	SID_STOP()	  - Stop current tune
	SID_PAUSE()	  - Toggles the pause state of the current playing
	                    tune
	SID_QUIT()	  - Quit PlaySID
	SID_LOAD(module)  - Load <module> into PlaySID
	SID_SETTUNE(tune) - Set <tune> to current one
	SID_NUMTUNES()	  - return number of tunes
	SID_SHOW()	  - Show PlaySID windows
	SID_HIDE()	  - Hide PlaySID windows


TOOL TYPE INFO:

	Syntax of the Tooltypes of <tune>.info:

	   SIDSONG = <Yes|No>
	
	If "yes", the module is recognized as a Compute! SID .mus-file.
	Default is "No".

	   ADDRESS = <loadaddress>,<initaddress>,<playaddress> ;in hex

	loadaddress should be the C64 adress where the file should be loaded.
	If 0 is specified, the first two bytes of the file will instead be
	used as loadaddress.
	
	initaddress should point to a subroutine which initializes the tunenr
	in accumulator (starting with $00). If 0 is specified, then the
	initaddress will be the first C64 address loaded.

	playaddress should point to a subroutine which plays a note of the
	song. This will be called as often as described in the speed
	parameter. If 0 is specified, then the playaddress will be the
	address of the interrupt initialized by the subroutine at the
	initaddress. This address will be the contents of $0314/0315 or
	$FFFE/FFFF depending on what value $0001 contains.

	   SONGS = <nr of songs>,[<start song nr>] ;in dec

	The number of tunes the module have and the startup tune to play.
	Default values are 1 tune and the first tune as startup tune.

	   SPEED = <speeddata> ;in hex

	speeddata contains info about playspeed. For each tune a bit is
	reserved, bit 0 for tune nr 1 and so on. A 0 bit means vertical	sync
	(50Hz PAL or 60Hz NTSC) and a 1 bit means 60 Hz or the 	time set in
	$DC04/05. Default value is 0 for all bits.

	   NAME = <name of the module> ;in ascii

	   AUTHOR = <name of the author> ;in ascii

	   COPYRIGHT = <name of the copyright owner> ;in ascii

	Default values are "?" for the above three tooltypes.


TECHNICAL INFO:

	PlaySID is written with GnuEmacs 18.58 and compiled with SAS/C 6.50
	and Devpac 3.02 assembler. The user interface was designed with
	Toolmaker. It uses about 50kB of chip memory and 160kB of other
	memory. If playing samples or rewind option is on, more memory will
	be used. Also add the length of the tune to the amount of other
	memory.


FUTURE FEATURES:

	This is a list of features that still isn't included into the current
	version. They will probably be included in future versions.

	* Save C64 pictures as IFF files.
	* Show Compute! SID ".mus" file information.
	* Utilities to create icon files and convert to/from different
	  playsid fileformats.
	* Features YOU would like to be added (PLEASE WRITE AND TELL US).
