SetTDDelay is a very small and simple 2.04-only utility which sets the
public fields tdu_StepDelay, tdu_SettleDelay and tdu_CalibrateDelay of the
trackdisk.device public unit. You can specify zero or more units (specifying
no unit is equivalent to specifying all units). For instance

SetTDDelay 0 2 StepDelay 5000

will set the step delay of units 0 and 2 to 5000µs, while

SetTDDelay CalibrateDelay 3000

will set the calibrate delay for all units to 3000µs. If you don't specify
any of the keywords StepDelay, SettleDelay or CalibrateDelay SetTDDelay will
simply print the current settings of trackdisk.device. SetTDDelay's template
will be printed if you specify the standard '?' argument. SetTDDelay is a
pure command and can be made resident.

You should never change the delays of a public unit unless you really know
what you're doing. This command has been distributed because some drives
used with the Amiga are out of specs, and this causes SuperDuper 2.0 to
complain ("Error while recalibrating"). The suggestion is to set the step
and calibrate delay of the guilty unit to 5000µs with a

SetTDDelay <unit number> StepDelay 5000 CalibrateDelay 5000

This operation is equivalent to using Leonard Poma's m5afix program (a patch
which sets to 5000 the step delay). m5afix works also under 1.3. SetTDDelay
it's more flexible but works only under 2.04.
