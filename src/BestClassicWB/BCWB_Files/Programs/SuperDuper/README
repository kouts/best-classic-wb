Welcome to the release 3.11 of SuperDuper.

The program has been largely rewritten since version 2.02. Now it works only
under Release 2+, and supports many features of 3.0. There is support for Xpk
and high density disks. Please reread entirely the manual.

The changes from version 3.0 are mainly bug fixes and some new features, namely
optional simple refresh windows, the new NoStartup switch, automatic source
disk reads, and better window management.

The documentation is provided in Texinfo format (SuperDuper.texinfo),
PostScript format (SuperDuper.ps) AmigaGuide® format (SuperDuper.guide), and
plain ASCII (SuperDuper.doc).
