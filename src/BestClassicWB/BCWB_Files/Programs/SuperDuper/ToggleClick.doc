ToggleClick is a very small and simple 2.04-only utility which toggles the
TDP_NOCLICK flags. When this flag is on for a drive, the drive won't click.
There are many utilities which already offer the same functionality, but
ToggleClick is 444 bytes long and allows to set/clear the flags selectively.
If you specify the KILLALL switch, all the drives will be hushed. If you
specify a series of unit numbers, for instance

ToggleClick 0 2

the corrisponding flags will be toggled. This means that you can activate
and deactivate drive clicking at your will. ToggleClick's template will be
printed if you specify the standard '?' argument. ToggleClick is a pure
command and can be made resident.
