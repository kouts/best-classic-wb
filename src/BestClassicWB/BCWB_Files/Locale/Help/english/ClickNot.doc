  ClickNot is to stop your floppy disks from clicking :-)

  It works under WB2 and above and can be run from the CLI, the
  Workbench or from your WBStartup draw. It will automatically detect
  DF0: to DF3: and stop them clicking. In it's grotesque 348 bytes it
  even has a version string!

  The user interface was designed with GadToolsBox By Jan v.d. Baard,
  and the program compiled with SAS/C V6.3 on a WB3 A2000/030/33
