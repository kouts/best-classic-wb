NAME
	exe2arc 1.5

SYNOPSIS
	exe2arc FROM/A,TO,TYPE/K

DESCRIPTION
	This program extracts the archive data from self extracting
	archive files. You can afterwards use that archive with xad
	or any other unarchiver. It equals the executable file, except
	the exe header is stripped and offsets are corrected. It works
	with all executable formats, which contain valid archive data.

	Currently Zip, Rar, LhA, Cabinet, Arj and Ace are supported.
	Always test the extracted archive, as it may be damaged.

	FROM specifies the exe file archive that should be handled.

	TO is the name of destination archive file. This is automatically
	created, if not given. It also maybe the name of a directory, where
	the file should be stored.

	TYPE allows to specify the archive type (if known). You always
	need to specify the TYPE keyword. The type may be specified using
	the archive format extension or the type name displayed, when
	archives are found.

EXAMPLE
	Shell> exe2arc pk204g.exe
