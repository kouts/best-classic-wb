NAME
	xadList 1.0

SYNOPSIS
	xadList FILE/M,ALL/S,NE=NOEXTERN/S

DESCRIPTION
	xadList examines files and prints the names of the
	archivers.

	FILE specifies the file/drawer that should be examined.
	Wildcards of any kind are supported. You can specify
	multiple filenames or directories. If FILE is not
	specified, the current directory will be examined.

	If you specify a directory, the directory is entered
	and the contents is shown also without ALL option. If
	you use wildcards in the name the directory is listed
	normally, but you may add /#? to show its contents.

	xadList only examines one directory level. With ALL,
	it goes as deep as possible.

	NOEXTERN prohibits the use of external clients for
	recognition purposes.

EXAMPLES
	Shell> xadList HD0:C/#? HD0:Libs/
		Examines the contents of HD0:C and HD0:Libs.

	Shell> xadList DF0:#?/#?.#? ALL
		Examines any drawer deeper than level one
		on DF0: for filenames ending with an extension
