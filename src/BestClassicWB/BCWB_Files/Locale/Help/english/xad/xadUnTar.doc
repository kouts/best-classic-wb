SYNOPSIS
	xadUnTar FROM/A,DEST=DESTDIR,PASSWORD/K,FILE/M,NAMESIZE/K/N,
	FFS=OFS/S,SFS/S,INFO=LIST/S,Q=QUIET/S,AM=ASKMAKEDIR/S,

	NKP=NOKILLPART/S,NP=NOPROT/S,NT=NOTREE/S,SHORTNAME/S

DESCRIPTION
	xadUnTar is a shell tool to extract data from Tar archives and
	compressed Tar archives. This includes .tar.bz, .tar.bz2,
	.tar.gz, .tar.Z, .tar and others.

	FROM specifies the file archive that should be handled.
	DESTDIR is the destination directory. The directory is created
	when it does not exist (except if ASKMAKEDIR is turned on and
	you select no). There are some dangerous archives using absolute
	path names (e.g. starting with LIBS: or RAM:). xadUnTar archives
	these files to their absolute position (except NOTREE or NOABS is
	used).

	PASSWORD can be used to supply a password for unarchiving of
	encrypted archives. This argument requires the keyword PASSWORD.

	FILE allows you to select filename(s) (including patterns), which
	should be extracted. When FILE is not given, all files are
	extracted. With FILE only matching files are extracted.
	NOTE: When you do not use NOTREE keyword, the patterns check
	includes checks for directory structure as well.

	NAMESIZE allows to specify the maximum size of a filename. This is
	useful as some archives from unix machines have longer filenames
	than the Amiga filesystem allows. Whenever a name is longer than
	the namesize value, you are asked to enter a shorter name. Names
	of directories are truncated without requests.
	FFS or OFS replace NAMESIZE argument and provide a standard length
	of 30 characters, which is the value of our standard file system.
	SFS provide a length of 100 characters, the SmartFilesystem
	standard.

	NOEXTERN prohibits the use of external clients for
	recognition purposes.
	
	INFO or LIST prints information about the archive and does not
	do any unarchiving.
	
	OVERWRITE forces the program to overwrite an already existing
	destination file. Normally you are asked about that.
	
	NOTREE skips all directory names and writes the files directly to
	destination directory.

	SHORTNAME shortens the displayed name for INFO and extract. Now only
	the filename instead of path and filename is presented.

	ASKMAKEDIR forces the program to ask you, if a missing directory
	should be created.

	NOPROT prevents setting file protection bits and NODATE prevents
	setting date information.

	NOABS prevents creation of absolute path names.

	If you specify NOKILLPART keyword, partial or corrupt output files
	no longer are deleted.

	The QUIET option turns off the progress report, but also disables
	questions to skip, rename or overwrite files.

EXAMPLES

		gzipped tar archive to RAM:

	Shell> xadUnTar archive.tar.bz LIST
		Tells information about archive.tar.bz file.
