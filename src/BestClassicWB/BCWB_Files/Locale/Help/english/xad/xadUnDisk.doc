	xadUnDisk 1.16

SYNOPSIS
	xadUnDisk FROM/A,TO,LOWCYL/N,HIGHCYL/N,ENTRY/N,PASSWORD,
	SAVETEXTS/K,NE=NOEXTERN/S,INFO=LIST/S,SHOWTEXTS/S,OW=OVERWRITE/S,
	IG=IGNOREGEOMETRY/S,FORMAT/S,DIMG=DISKIMAGE/S,NAI=NOASKINSERT/S,
	USL=USESECTORLABELS

DESCRIPTION
	xadUnDisk is the master shell tool to extract data from
	disk archives.

	FROM specifies the disk archive that should be handled. Patterns
	are supported

	TO is the destination. This maybe an device name like RAD:
	or any file name. TO is required when LIST option is not
	specified. When extracted to a file, this is a floppy
	image file (often called ADF), which can be used with all
	ADF dealing tools.
	
	LOWCYL and HIGHCYL name the lowest and highest cylinder that
	should be dearchived. Note that some clients do not support
	cylinder based dearchiving and thus ignore these options.

	ENTRY specifies the entry, which should be dearchived. Normal
	disk archives only store 1 entry, so there is no need for that
	option, but maybe there are multi-disk-archivers and then you
	need that option to specify the wanted entry. This is a decimal
	number. The first entry has number 1.

	PASSWORD can be used to supply a password for unarchiving of
	encrypted archives.

	After the SAVETEXTS keyword you may specify a filename which
	should be used to save information texts. The name gets an
	additional point and the text number. E.g. "SAVETEXTS text"
	produces files text.1, text.2, ...

	NOEXTERN prohibits the use of external clients for
	recognition purposes.
	
	INFO or LIST prints information about the archive and does not
	do any unarchiving.
	
	SHOWTEXTS tells the program to display information texts, if
	there are some of them in the archive.
	
	OVERWRITE forces the program to overwrite an already existing
	destination file.
	
	IGNOREGEOMETRY forces the tool to ignore wrong drive geometry
	when unarchiving to an device.

	Specify USESECTORLABELS when you want to store SectorLabels onto
	disk (no effect for output files). Not all archivers support them
	and not all destination device types support this storage. Most
	time you will not need this switch, as the labels nearly never
	contain useful information.

	If the destination disk is not formatted, use FORMAT to do this
	together with writing.

	Specify DISKIMAGE, if you want to write a disk image to floppy
	disk. The program also asks you, if you want to handle a file
	as image, if the data type is not detected without DIMG keyword.
	This can also be used to read a disk-image from a device or to
	copy 2 disks.

	Specify NOASKINSERT if you do not like to be asked to insert disk.

EXAMPLES
	Shell> xadUnDisk archive.dms RAD:
		Unarchive the dms file to RAD:

	Shell> xadUnDisk archive.dms LIST
		Tells information about archive.dms file.
