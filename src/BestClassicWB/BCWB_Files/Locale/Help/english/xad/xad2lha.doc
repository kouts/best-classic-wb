NAME
	xad2lha 1.3

SYNOPSIS
	xad2lha FROM/A,TO,PASSWORD/K,NE=NOEXTERN/S,QUIET/S,HEADER0/S

DESCRIPTION
	xad2lha extracts data from other archives and stores it in an
	lha archive.
	This program transfers all additionally information, like UNIX
	owner stuff and protection bits.

	FROM specifies the file archive that should be handled.

	TO is the name of destination lha file. When not specified, the
	source name extensions are stripped and .lha is added.

	PASSWORD can be used to supply a password for unarchiving of
	encrypted archives. This argument requires the keyword PASSWORD.

	NOEXTERN prohibits the use of external clients for
	recognition purposes.

	HEADER0 uses header level 0. This header is older and does not
	have special information.

	The QUIET option makes the program really silent.

DATA FORMAT
	This tool normally creates files using header level 2.
	Uncompressable files are stored using -lh0-, all the others use
	-lh5- identifier. Directories use -lhd- identifier. The OS-ID is
	set to 'A', which is used by other Amiga lha programs.
	Following header information is included:

	0x00 CRC		  always
	0x01 file name		  except it is an directory
	0x02 directory name	  except the file name has no directory part
	0x50 UNIX protection bits if there are group or other bits
	0x51 UNIX owner ID's	  only if user or group ID is not zero
	0x52 UNIX group name	  if exists
	0x53 UNIX user name	  if exists
	0x54 UNIX date		  always, except if source archive had no
				  date (no UTC correction, but local time)
	0x71 comment		  if exists

	When HEADER0 ist used, then directories are stored using -lh0- and
	a slash at name end. Comments are included in file name field and
	are seperated by a zero byte. Additionally header information is not
	supported with that format.

	Standard protection bits and time stamp are always included in both
	headers.
