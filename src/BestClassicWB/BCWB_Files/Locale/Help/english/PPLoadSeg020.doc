PPLoadseg 2.1 (39.1) is based on v37.4 which was I believe the final
version written by Nico François, back in 1991 (Six years ago!)

Changes:

o Many small optimisations.

o Patch now uses 68020+ opcodes for slight speed increase, and a few
  bytes less memory usage

o Now uses DECR_NONE, instead of DECR_POINTER. This will prevent all
  those boot-pictures that use more than 16 colours from flashing.

o Made all code PC relative, making the file lots smaller (No reloc-tables)

o Now uses OpenLibrary instead of OldOpenLibrary.
  (No difference, just more 90's IMHO)

o Uses a global PrintTxt routine to cut down the size a little.

o Caches cleared after installing patches, as there is self-modifying
  code in use.

o Zero data moved to end of hunks to allow BSS areas to be used.
