short: substitute loadseg'd programs with others

                ToolAlias requires AmigaDos 2.0 or higher.

ToolAlias  provides  a  mechanism  for rerouting specific programs to other
programs.  For example, with ToolAlias, you could reroute all references to
':c/muchmore'  to use instead 'sys:utilities/ppmore', so that when browsing
documents on a Fish disk, you get to use your favourite text viewer, rather
than loading the one specified in the document's ToolTypes.

I  take  no credit for this idea:  I got it from a program called Replex by
Ekke  Verheul,  that  appeared  on a recent fish disk.  That program was as
good  as  this incarnation, except that the method of patching the AmigaDos
LoadSeg routine caused software failures when (blink-created) overlays were
loaded.   Since  one  of  the  programs  I  use  a  lot (Yak) utilised such
overlays, Replex was unusable on my system.  But I really liked the idea.

So,  now  the  instructions.   ToolAlias is implemented as a commodity that
should  be  started  by  dropping its icon into your WBStartup drawer.  The
DONOTWAIT  ToolType  should  therefore  be  set;  the  standard Commodities
ToolTypes  may  also  be  used,  to modify ToolAlias's HotKey and determine
whether or not the settings window opens on startup.

The standard Commodities ToolTypes are:

Name		Default		Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
CX_PRIORITY	0		Commodity priority.
CX_POPUP	TRUE		Whether to show window on startup.
CX_POPKEY	control alt t	Key to open/show settings window.

The  settings  window may be opened at startup, or more usually by pressing
the  HotKey  (or  using the Exchange).  The window has a number of gadgets,
whose use should be fairly obvious; the descriptions are:

	Old	The old name to be substituted
	New	The new name to replace the old name

	<<	Move to start of list of substitutions
	<	Move to previous member in list
	Add	Add a new entry after the current member
	Del	Delete current member
	>	Move to next member in list
	>>	Move to end of list of substitutions

	Save	Save current configuration (and close window)
	Load	Restore last-saved configuration
	Use	Use current configuration (and close window)
	Quit	Terminate ToolAlias, removing patches        

The   configuration   is  saved  to  the  file  's:ToolAlias.config'.


(slightly) Technical Details
----------------------------
The  system  LoadSeg  routine  is  patched, and a list of all substitutions
kept.   When  a program calls LoadSeg with a name, the patch first searches
it's  list  for  a  matching  name,  and  if  found, calls LoadSeg with the
corresponding new name. When names are compared, case is insignigicant.

Heres an example list:

	old	:c/less
	new	ppmore

	old	:c/muchmore
	new	ppmore

	old	:c/xicon
	new 	c:xicon

	old	:c/iconx
	new	c:iconx

This  list  would  enable  you  to  browse  Fish disks while using your own
preferred text viewer (in this example ppmore), and the Workbench scripting
programs from your own C:  directory (which may be on a hard-disk, sppeding
things  up).   I  should  stress  that  names  must  match  exactly  to  be
substituted;  with the above list, a default tool of 'muchmore' wouldn't be
substituted with another name as it doesn't match any of the 'old' names.

I  have  to be honest and say I can't think of any uses for ToolAlias other
than  circumventing default tool types with your own preferences, but since
I get a lot of PD stuff and magazine coverdisks, I find it useful.


History
-------
 v1.02	- enforcer-hit removed.

	- cache-friendly patching now used.

 v1.01	- initial release.


Distribution
------------
As  with  all  my programs, ToolAlias is freeware, though I'm not averse to
receiving contributions should you feel the need to send them.  Source in C
is  included,  and  compiles  with  SAS/C  v5.10.   ToolAlias comes with no
warranties,   and  any  loss  or  damage  arising  from  it's  use  is  the
responsibility of the user, you, not the programmer, me.  This isn't to say
that I think it will crash your system (in fact I'm pretty sure it won't).
