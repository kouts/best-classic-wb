REQUIREMENTS
 Any Amiga® (compatible) computer with at least OS3.5.


DESCRIPTION
 This program is used to copy the icon images from one icon
 to another one.


USAGE
 From a shell:
  CopyIcon sourceicon desticon1 [desticon2...]
  
 From wb:
  click on CopyIcon,
  shift-click the source icon,
  shift-click the destination icon(s) (double click the last
  icon to start the program).
  
 This program can also be started from the Tools menus using
 Toolmanager.
 
 Starting 44.1 the following options/tooltypes are recognized:
 
 OPTIMIZE: try to optimize the image space by removing all unused
  colors from the colormap.

 DROPPLANAR: do not save the oldstyle/planar icon images.
 
 DROPNEWICON: save NewIcons as os3.5 icons instead of writing the
  NewIcon tooltypes back to disk.
 
 FRAMELESS: make the icon(s) frameless.
 
 DESTTYPE: convert the icon to the given type, recognized types
  are: project, tool, disk, drawer, garbage
 
 CHANGEONLY: only change icons of the given type (project, tool,
  disk, drawer, garbage). Leaves all other icons unchanged.
 
 DEFTOOL: the default tool of a project icon.

 If you don't give any source and/or destination icon(s), the program
 will put a small GUI that allows you to copy icon images from one icon
 to another one by drag and drop. To do so, simply drop the source icon
 on the left dropbox and the destination icon(s) on the right box.
