                       VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION                        
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many of the viruses we have added to this VirusZ_III.Bootblocks, will make
checksum changes with each mutation,  so there is  absolutely no guarantee
the new  viruses we have added,  will be reportet as a virus.  But we will
add as many mutations as we can.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                LEGAL STUFF
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Virus Help Team have made this file,  because there is nothing else we can
we don't know anything about programming,  and we can't make  an antivirus
program. So we thik this is better than nothing.

But Georg Wittmann is back, and will update VirusZ III and the xvs.library
when he has  the time, and  when Georg Wittmann  has added  the  bootblock
viruses  and clones  from the VirusZ_III.Bootblocks to the xvs.library, we
delete the viruses we have added and leave the harmless bootblocks in this
file.

If you have  a bootblock collection, please send it to us. Then we can add
more unknown bootblocks and name them to the VirusZ_III.Bootblocks file.
You can find our e-mail adress a few line down.

The  VirusZ_III.bootblocks is  free for anyone to use.  The file  contains
some of  the  bootblocks  that  Virus Help Team  have  collected  over the
years, and that VirusZ III does not recognize,  and reports as a  'Unknown
Bootblock'. But now VirusZ will report them by name. New bootblock viruses
that VirusZ,  with the use of xvs.library v33.45, cant recognize, will now
be reported.

Just put the VirusZ_III.Bootblocks in your S: drawer. If you  already have
set  VirusZ III to  learn some  bootblocks,  you  can merge the Virus Help
Teams bootblock file with your own.

Requirements:
-------------
VirusZ III v1.04b
xvs.library v33.46

            VIRUS HELP TEAM - LOOKING FOR ANTIVIRUS PROGRAMMERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

No one from Virus Help Team knows anything about programming at all. So we
are  currently looking for an antivirus  programmers that can  help us, by
making a brand new antivirus  program, that must support  the xvs.library,
xadmaster.library, xfdmaster.library. And must  be working  from Kickstart
2.04 and forward.
Virus Help Team will support you with all new viruses an trojans, that has
been found since the release of xvs.library v33.45.

Just to be on the safe side, we will need to see an antivirus program that
you have made,  supporting  the library's above, before  we will  send any
viruses or trojans.

If you want to know more.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      VIRUSZ III v1.04b BOOTBLOCK LAB
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just copy the VirusZ_III.Bootblocks into your S: drawer.

If you already use the 'Learn' option with  VirusZ III, you can merge your
file  with this one from Virus Help Team, by  using the functions  via the
bootblock lab gadget.

Brain/Merge Brains:
Adds brain cells from a second file to the currently loaded brain.

Read the documentation for VirusZ III v1.04b for further information.

'Brain/Edit Brain':
Here you can rename or delete brain cells.

        VIRUSZ_III.BOOTBLOCKS - RELEASE HISTORY BY VIRUS HELP TEAM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Released date: 28 april 2022
VirusZ_III.Bootblocks file size: 62.370 bytes
-----------------
Deleted  11 bootblock  viruses and  clones from the VirusZ_III.Bootblocks,
because Georg Wittmann has  released an  update of  the xvs.library 33.46,
and Georg has added these deleted 11  viruses the xvs.library. So there is
no need for them in the VirusZ_III.Bootblocks file anymore.

VirusZ_III.Bootblocks will still detect 1.981 harmless bootblocks by name.
