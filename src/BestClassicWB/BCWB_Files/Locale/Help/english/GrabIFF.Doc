     1. A short introduction
     -----------------------

        GrabIFF  is  a  program  which allows you to grab IFF-pictures or
     -brushes  from  any  screen,  window  or  mousepointer provided that
     multitasking  is not turned off.  These IFF-files can then be loaded
     and edited by almost any paint program.

        You  can  either save the contents of a specific screen or window
     or  just  a  portion  of a screen.  As an additional feature GrabIFF
     gives  you  the  possibility  to  save mousepointers as IFF-brushes.
     GrabIFF will only work on Amigas with at least OS 2.04 installed.


     2. What it does
     ---------------

        When  GrabIFF  is  installed  you  can  activate it by a specific
     combination  of  qualifier  keys (these are control, caps lock, alt,
     shift  and  amiga).   By  default  you  just  press  the control key
     together with the left amiga key - an easy to reach combination.  If
     you  don't  like  this (or it collides with the hotkey of some other
     program you use) you can choose any combination you like.

        When  GrabIFF  detects  this  specified  qualifier combination it
     draws  a  crosshair  on  the  active  screen.   Now  there  are five
     different ways to continue:

     a) Grab the whole screen
        To  grab the whole screen just hit the 's' (s = screen) key while
        still holding the qualifiers down.

     b) Grab the active window
        To grab the active window just hit the 'w' (w = window) key while
        still holding the qualifiers down.

     c) Grab the actual mouse pointer
        To  grab  the actual mouse pointer just hit the 'p' (p = pointer)
        key while still holding the qualifiers down.

     d) Grab any portion of the screen
        To  grab  a rectangular portion of the screen you should move the
        mouse  to  any  one  of the four corners of the desired rectangle
        while  still  holding  the  qualifier down.  Press the left mouse
        button  and  hold  it  down.  The crosshair becomes a rubberband.
        Now  drag the mouse (still hold the qualifiers and the left mouse
        button  down)  to  the opposite edge of the rectangle and release
        the mouse button.

     e) Cancel the operation
        To  cancel  the  operation  at  any point just release any of the
        qualifier keys.

        As  default  GrabIFF  saves the grabbed pictures to the RAM:-disk
     with the names 'GrabIFF.001', 'GrabIFF.002' etc.

        Grabbing  windows  is  a  bit  complicated  if  these windows are
     overlapped  by  some  other windows.  If the window at the back is a
     super  bitmap  or smart refresh window, the hidden regions are saved
     by  the layers.library and can be accessed without problems.  If the
     window  uses  the  simple  refresh method (like Shell windows or the
     Workbench),  the  hidden  regions will be redrawn by the application
     not  until  the  window  is  revealed.   That's why GrabIFF brings a
     window  to  the  front before grabbing it.  This works well with all
     windows  except  backdrop  windows  -  these  cannot be moved to the
     front.   In this case you should first close all other windows which
     hide the one you want to grab.


     3. Installation
     ---------------

        GrabIFF  consists  of  two  parts:  the program 'GrabIFF' itself,
     which  can  be  placed  anywhere,  and the handler 'GrabIFFHandler',
     which must be placed in the 'L:'-directory.

        Workbench-Users  should  click  the  'InstallHandler'-Icon, which
     copies  the  Handler to the desired directory.  Then you should move
     'GrabIFF'  to a suitable directory like 'Tools' or 'Utilities' where
     you  can find it easily when you need it.  If you want GrabIFF to be
     started automatically every time you start or reboot your amiga, you
     should   place   it   into   the   'WBStartup'-directory   of   your
     'WB_2.x'-disk.  To stop the program just start it again.

        Shell-Users  can  use  the  InstallHandler-Skript  to copy the
     Handler  to  the  'L:'-directory (or just the 'Copy'-command...).
     Then  copy  'GrabIFF'  to  your 'C:'-directory.  To start GrabIFF
     just type 'GrabIFF' on the command line.  You don't need 'Run' or
     'RunBack',  since  it just installs the handler in the background
     and then returns to the Shell.  To stop the program just start it
     again.


     4. Options
     ----------

        There are lots of options which control the behaviour of GrabIFF.
     In the normal case you don't need any of those, so GrabIFF will work
     completely as stated above.

        The  options  are  valid  for  both  Workbench-  and Shell-users.
     Workbench-users  can  enter the options as tooltypes (have a look at
     your   Workbench-manual   for  more  information  about  tooltypes),
     Shell-users  enter  the  options  as usual after the command's name.
     Upper  and lower case are ignored.  When started from the Shell with
     a  '?' as the only argument, you will get a help string in the usual
     format  for  Shell  commands  (look  at  the  Shell  manual for more
     information).

     On
        Install GrabIFF.

     Off
        Remove  GrabIFF.  If neither 'On' nor 'Off' are given, the actual
        state  of  the  program  is inverted (that means:  if it was off,
        switch it on, otherwise switch it off).

     Quiet
        Normally GrabIFF shows you a requester saying 'GrabIFF installed'
        on startup.  This option diables the requester.

     Usage
        Show  a  requester  with  short  explanations  for  the different
        options (better have a look at this file!).

     AskName
        Normally  GrabIFF  saves the grabbed files under the standardname
        'RAM:GrabIFF'  with  extension  '.000', '.001', '.002' etc.  (see
        'STANDARDNAME' option).  If you specify this flag, every time you
        grab  a  file  the program will ask you for the name to save this
        file under, using a standard ASL requester.

     CheckOff
        When  GrabIFF  saves  a  file,  it  normally  checks if this file
        already  exists.   If  it  finds  a  file  with this name and you
        specified  the  'ASKNAME'  option, it will ask you if you want to
        overwrite  the old file.  If not, the operation will be canceled.
        If  you didn't specify 'ASKNAME', GrabIFF will try again with the
        next   extension.   That  means:   if  'RAM:GrabIFF.000'  already
        exists,  it  will  try to save it as 'RAM:GrabIFF.001' and so on.
        Use  the  'CHECKOFF'-option  to  turn  of the existence-check for
        files.

     CrosshairOff
        This option will turn the crosshair off, which by default appears
        when  pressing  the  qualifier  combination,  thus  disabling the
        option  of  grabbing  any  rectangle  from a screen.  This can be
        useful  when  you don't want GrabIFF to render anything into your
        screen.  I offer this option because the crosshair leaves a trail
        of  points when grabbing from the DPaint screen (all right, there
        is  no  need  to grab something from the DPaint screen, since you
        can  use  DPaint's  own  grab  facilities, but nevertheless - the
        option).
        The grabbing of complete screens, windows and mousepointers still
        works as explained above.

     PackOff
        By  default  GrabIFF  trys  to  pack the ILBM files by use of the
        standard  'cmpByteRun1'  encoding,  which  is understood by every
        program dealing with ILBM files.  If you don't want your files to
        be packed, specify this option.

     FrontScreen
        Normally  GrabIFF  works with Intuition's active screen - this is
        the screen on which the currently active window is located.  This
        behaviour  is  ok  for  almost  any  grabbing  purpose.  The only
        problem  arises  when  trying  to  grab  something  from a screen
        without  any  window.  You can't make this screen the active one,
        since  you  can't  activate  a  window on it!  In such a case you
        should use this option.  GrabIFF will now work with the frontmost
        screen  instead of the active one.   Now bring your screen to the
        front and grab it!

     Icons
        If  you  want to access a file from the Workbench, the file needs
        an  icon  attached to it (or you should use 'Show all files' from
        the  'Window'-menu).   Specify this option if you want GrabIFF to
        save an icon for every grabbed file.

     Verbose
        When  this option is given, GrabIFF will show you a requester for
        evry  saved  file, telling you the name it was saved to, its size
        and its depth.

     Error=None|Beep|Window
        If  an error occurs while grabbing (not enough memory, file could
        not  be opened etc.), GrabIFF opens a requester telling you about
        the  nature  of  the  problem.   If  you  specify 'None' for this
        option,  errors  will be ignored.  'Beep' will only force a short
        beep  if any error is detected and 'Window' gives you the default
        setting.

     Standardname
        If  you  don't  specify  the  'ASKNAME' option, the files will be
        automatically   stored   with   a   standardname   (defaults   to
        'RAM:GrabIFF')  and a numerical extension.  This option gives you
        the  possibility  to  change  the  standardname  to  any path and
        filename  you  like.   You  should  allways  specify  a  complete
        pathname  including a device specification (like 'RAM:', 'WORK:',
        'DF0:',  'GRAB:');  otherwise  the  files  will  be stored to the
        directory which was the actual one when GrabIFF was started!

     Qualifier=nnn
        'nnn'   is   a  decimal  number  which  describes  the  qualifier
        (qualifiers  are:  control, caps lock, shift, alt, amiga) used to
        activate GrabIFF (defaults to the control key in combination with
        the left amiga key).  The qualifiers have the following values:
           Left Shift  1
           Right Shift 2
           Caps Lock   4
           Control     8
           Left Alt    16
           Right Alt   32
           Left Amiga  64
           Right Amiga 128
        If  you  want  a  combination  of  qualifiers  you simply add the
        values.

     WindowCode=nnn
        'nnn'  is a decimal number which specifies the rawkey code of the
        button  you  have  to press in combination with the qualifiers to
        make  GrabIFF  save the actual window.  This defaults to 17 which
        is  the  rawkey  code for 'w'.  If you don't know this codes, you
        should use the commodity window (see below) to alter the hotkey.

     ScreenCode=nnn
        This  option  works  as the 'WINDOWCODE' option and sets the code
        for grabbing of screens.

     PointerCode=nnn
        This  option  works  as the 'WINDOWCODE' option and sets the code
        for grabbing of mouse pointers.

     Cx_Priority=nnn
        The  decimal  number  'nnn'  specifies  the priority of GrabIFF's
        inputhandler.

     Cx_PopUp=yes|no
        Please  enter either 'yes' or 'no' for this option.  In the first
        case  GrabIFF will automatically open its commodity window, where
        you can adjust all the settings by the use of gadgets.


     5. Some examples
     ----------------

     This  are some examples for how to start GrabIFF from the shell.  To
     use  the  examples  from  the workbench just enter every option as a
     single tool type in GrabIFF's info-window.

     GrabIFF On CrosshairOff FrontScreen Standardname=GRAB:NewGrab/XXX
        Start  GrabIFF  (or  give an error message if it's just running).
        The  crosshair  is  disabled  and grabbing will take place in the
        frontmost  (not in the active) screen.  The grabbed pictures will
        be  saved as 'GRAB:NewGrab/XXX.000', 'GRAB:NewGrab/XXX.001', etc.
        provided  that  there  is  a device named 'GRAB' which contains a
        directory name 'NewGrab'.

     GrabIFF Off
        Stop GrabIFF (or give an error message if it wasn't running yet).

     GrabIFF Qualifier=25 WindowCode=35 ScreenCode=53 PointerCode=21
        Use  the  combination of the control key, left shift and left alt
        to  activate  GrabIFF.   Screens  can  be  saves with the 'b' key
        (Bildschirm),  windows using 'f' (Fenster) and mousepointer using
        'z' (Zeiger).

     GrabIFF On CX_PopUp=Yes Icons
        Start  GrabIFF (if it wasn't running yet) and open up the control
        window.   All  new  files  will be accessable by Workbench, since
        GrabIFF now generates Icons.


     6. Commodities
     --------------

        GrabIFF  can  be controlled via the Commodities Exchange tool you
     find  on your Workbench disk.  It may be freely enabled, disabled or
     killed.   When  you  use  the  'Show'-Button  (or the 'Cx_PopUp=yes'
     option  an  startup)  GrabIFF  opens  a special window where you can
     control all the programs features.

        In  the  field labeled 'Grab-Codes' you can enter three different
     rawkey  codes.   The  first  one  will  make GrabIFF save the actual
     screen,  the second the actual window and the third the actual mouse
     pointer.   If  you  know  the  rawkey  code  of  the desired key (an
     overview  can  be  found  in  the Amiga Rom Kernel Reference Manual:
     Devices),  you  can  enter  it  in the second row of string gadgets,
     labeled 'Code'.  If you don't know the rawkey code (or if you are to
     lazy  to  search for it) you can enter the desired key itself in the
     first row of the string gadgets (labeled 'Key').  GrabIFF translates
     this  key  into  the  equivalent  rawkey  code  (don't forget to hit
     'Return' or 'Enter').

        In  the field named 'Qualifier' you can choose the combination of
     qualifiers which will activate GrabIFF.

        The  third  field  gives  you  control over the other features of
     GrabIFF.   The  gadgets will be explained from left to right and top
     to bottom.

        The  first  first gadget lets you specify, whether GrabIFF should
     check  for the existence of a file before saving it or whether files
     will be overwritten (see the 'CHECKOFF'-otpion).  In the next gadget
     you can choose between saving files with a standardname or different
     names  GrabIFF  will  prompt you for (see 'ASKNAME'-option).  In the
     following  string-gadget  you can enter the standardname to use (see
     'STANDARDNAME'-option).   In  the second row you can tell GrabIFF to
     compress  the files, to save icons and to be verbose (see discussion
     of  the  options  'PACKOFF', 'ICONS' and 'VERBOSE').  The gadgets of
     the  last  row  let  you  decide  if  you want to use the crosshair,
     whether  GrabIFF  should grab the active or the frontmost screen and
     how  to  handle any error (see options 'CROSSHAIROFF', 'FRONTSCREEN'
     and 'ERROR').

        At  the bottom of the window you find three more gadgets:  'Hide'
     closes  the  window,  keeping  GrabIFF still in memory, while 'Quit'
     closes  the  window and removes the program.  The third button 'Save
     to  Icon'  is  only  available  when  the  program  was started from
     Workbench.   In  this  case  you  can  save  the  actual settings as
     tooltypes  to  GrabIFF's  icon,  so  they will by active on the next
     start of the program.  There's no service like this for Shell-users;
     you  have  to  type  it  to  the  command  line by yourself (I think
     Shell-users like typing, so this should be no problem for you...).


     7. Caveats
     ----------

        Though  I  used  this  program  for  a  couple  of  weeks without
     problems,  there  may be any number of lurking bugs in it.  So if it
     low-level-formats  your  harddisk,  makes  your monitor explode into
     lots  of  little  pieces,  gobbles  down  your dog or drinks all the
     liquid  from  your neighbour's aquarium, making his goldfish gasping
     for water - please don't blame it on me!

        Following  this  comes some legal stuff which sounds very well to
     me.   I took it from the readme file for Arq, which is a very, very,
     very  good  and  useful  program.   Hi,  Martin,  if  you would have
     mentioned  your adress in this file, I would have sent you something
     for  your  work.   But,  maybe,  you will find GrabIFF a bit useful,
     too...


     8. Legal Stuff
     --------------

        The  author  will  not  be liable for any damage arising from the
     failure  of this program to perform as described, or any destruction
     of other programs or data residing on a system attempting to run the
     program.   While the author knows of no damaging errors, the user of
     this program uses it at his or her own risk.


     9. Credits
     ----------

        Well,  you  may  have noticed that GrabIFF looks a bit (or even a
     bit  more)  like Preben Nielsen's program PicSaver.  I used this one
     for  a  short  time  and then wrote GrabIFF because there were a few
     things  I  didn't  like  about  PicSaver.   The  first thing is this
     annoying  window  always popping up and asking me for a filename.  I
     hated  this!   The  second  thing was its unability to grab graphics
     from  screens  without  windows,  which  I  needed  while developing
     another  program.   The commercial program GrabbIt on the other hand
     was  unable  to grab portions of a screen or just windows, but saved
     its  files  with  a  standard name and a numerical extension and was
     able  to  grab  graphics  from  raw  screens.   So  I decided to put
     together  all  the  good things from these two programs, added a few
     things and lots of options and there it is:  GrabIFF.

        Ok,  I have to confess that GrabIFF is a bit bigger than PicSaver
     (the  GrabIFFHandler  takes 14044 bytes, while the complete PicSaver
     only  needs  4560  bytes  on  disk).  But half of this (exactly 7668
     bytes  or  55%)  disk space is wasted by the extensive stuff for the
     commodity  window.   If  don't  need  this  window and want to use a
     smaller  version (6376 bytes of disk space) you can order it from me
     (see below).

        I'd  like  to  thank  Preben  Nielsen  for  the  ideas I found in
     PicSaver  (thank  you,  Preben)  and  I'd  like to thank the unknown
     author  of  GrabbIt  (though  I  won't  buy  it,  since I appreciate
     GrabIFF!).


     10. Other Stuff
     ---------------

        This  code  and documentation are freely distributable and may be
     used,  copied,  modified, fed to your cat or whatever you like to do
     with  it.  It would be nice not to remove this text when copying the
     program,  so  other  people  will  also  be  able  to understand its
     meaning.

        If  you  have  any questions, have ideas for special improvements
     (is there something else than screens, windows and mousepointers you
     wish  to  grab?),  want to have a look at the sources of the program
     (rather undocumented, I'm afraid), want to order the smaller version
     of GrabIFF or if you just want to thank me for this wonderful little
     tool,  you  should  send  me  some  money  (or  other  valuables), a
     self-adressed  and  stamped  envelope  (if you want response) and an
     empty disk (if you want the sources or the smaller version).

        GrabIFF  was  programmed  using the Aztec C 5.2a compiler, but it
     should be compilable with any of the Aztec compilers.


     11. An Apology
     --------------

     I'm  afraid  I  have  to  apologize  for the sometimes extremly poor
     quality  of  this  writing.  When I left school, my English was very
     bad.   Since  then I improved it a little bit by reading, re-reading
     and  re-re-reading  the  english  Rom Kernel Reference Manuals for a
     long  time  and  also placing them under my pillow to absorb them by
     osmosis  (this  joke © by Randell Jesup).  I also tried this with my
     AmigaDOS  manuals,  but that gave me extremly horrible nightmares of
     terrible  red monsters, at least ten foot tall, stalking me from the
     back  while I was sitting at my computer trying to program something
     useful  in  combination  with  the dos, with the four green flashing
     letters  of  'BCPL' on their chests and trying to beat me with their
     enormous  global  vectors.  I woke up crying and all my sheets soken
     wet and I never tried this again...
