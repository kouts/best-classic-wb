    A RunBack style program which use parm.library.  Runs programs
    in  WB  mode  from any CLI.  Programs are fully detached.  The
    program you run must support WB startup.

    Usage:

        WBRun Prog [args] [STACK size] [PRI pri] [DELAY sec] [SYNC]

    if you type:

        WBRun ?

    you will get this command template

        Prog/A,Args/M,STACK/K/N,PRI/K/N,DELAY/K/N,SYNC/S:

    that is to say, Prog must be specified, and other args are optionnal.

    Stack will overide icon stack if specified, so use with great care.
    Pri is 0 by default.
    Delay  is  in seconds.  WBRun will wait this delay once prog is loaded
    and run, and can be used to prevent disk trashing in script files.
    When you set the SYNC flag, WBRun will wait for program to finish
    before return. This may be usefull in scripts, especialy in ParM.

    Example:

        ITEM ADPro RUN Assign ADPRO: Work:ADPro ; WBRun SYNC ADPRO:ADPro ; Assign ADPRO:

        This will make it possible to run ADPro in WB mode even with
        commands runned in SHELL mode before and after.
        If you didn't understand, this item creates the ADPRO: assign,
        runs ADPro in WB mode, and then cancels the assign.

    WBRun is pure and can be made resident.

History:
