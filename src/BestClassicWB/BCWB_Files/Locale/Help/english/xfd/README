INTRODUCTION
------------
Almost  every  Amiga  user  has  some  crunched files on his/her disks,
either  Powerpacked docs or crunched demos, utilities or whatever.  But
what to do when you need the files to be uncrunched, and you don't call
the cruncher your own (or it does not support decrunching)? Enters XFD.

FEATURES
--------
This  software  package allows you to decrunch almost every packed file
known  on the Amiga.  It consists of the xfdmaster.library as the brain
and a couple of programs that offer certain functions to the user.

The  xfdmaster.library is a standard Amiga shared, runtime library.  It
works  with  Kickstart  V33+ and offers applications the possibility to
directly support any crunched files.

Other  than the predecessor decrunch.library, the xfdmaster.library has
a  more  flexible interface, offers the possibility to decrunch already
loaded  program  segments,  supports  external  decrunchers, is able to
unlink 4EB9/4EF9- and text-linked files  and can scan for crunched data
in any memory area.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
xfdmaster.library  requires  OS1.2 to work  properly.  To decrunch XPKF
files, you also need xpkmaster.library and the proper sub library.

All  included external  utilities need  OS2.0 or OS1.2 and arp.library,
with exception of xfdPatch and xfdDecrunchAddr which always need OS2.0.

EXTERNAL DECRUNCHERS
--------------------
External  decrunchers  can  be easily written by any programmer who has
knowledge  about the inner workings of a new cruncher.  That way almost
everybody is able to keep the library up-to-date.  External decrunchers
are  stored in "LIBS:xfd/" and xfdmaster.library loads them on startup.
Please  check  out  your own "LIBS:xfd/" drawer and compare it with the
latest  one included in this package.  The slaves from this package are
always  the latest versions.  There exist old external decrunchers that
are  no  longer  required,  please delete them from "LIBS:xfd/" to save
diskspace AND memory.  They are mentioned in "LIBS:xfd/.README.FIRST"

ATTENTION
---------
Although  I  clearly  stated  in the autodocs that external decrunchers
have  to  be fully reentrant (which means they can handle several files
within the same time), some externals are programmed not 100% safe.  If
you  ever  have trouble with XFD, first disable the external slaves and
then try again.  If there's still a problem, send me a bug report.

SUBMISSIONS
-----------
You are a programmer who has
- developed external decrunchers for xfdmaster.library?
- written applications that support xfdmaster.library?
You have new crunchers that are not supported yet?
Please send anything of the above to the following address:

( Georg Hörmann			)
( Martinswinkelstraße 16c	)
( 82467 Garmisch-Partenkirchen	)
( Germany			)

As  Georg  has  no time  to improve  xfdmaster.library, he gave  me the
sources to do further updates. Maybe in some future time he  will again
make  the library  himself,  but at  the moment  I am the author of the
xfdmaster.library.

You can contact me at:
Dirk Stöcker
Geschwister-Scholl-Straße 10
01877 Bischofswerda
GERMANY

or "stoecker@epost.de" or "dirk@dstoecker.de".

I still  need some of the  older crunchers,  strange data crunchers and
lots of linkers. Any sent stuff is welcome.

THANKS
------
Special  thanks  go  out  to  all the people who sent me new crunchers,
external  decrunchers,  bug  reports  or  whatever.  You will find your
names somewhere in the history.

HELP ME
-------
Who  is  interested  in writing a nice GUI for xfdmaster.library?  As I
don't  have  enough  time to do this myself, I'm searching for somebody
who  would  like  to  and has the skills to code a GUI-based all-in-one
xfdDecrunch/Unlink/List/Scan  utility.   It  should read files, analyse
them  quickly  (crunched?/linked?) scan them if necessary and save back
the  result.   All  this  combined  with  lots  of  options and default
settings would be very useful for all of us.

HISTORY

- Updated external TTW! (IFF cruncher) done by Ronald van Dijk. Thanks
  for the new version.

XFD 1.27 [xfdmaster.library 39.4]
- Fixed Segment recognition for Stonecracker 4 Library files. Thanks
  Håkan Parting for the report.
- Replaced =SB= external by LHA3 external, which doesn't crash and is
  written in C language. It also supports V39 stuff, data scanning and
  is a bit shorter.
  There exist some corrupt files due to a bug of LHA3 by Stefan Boberg.
- Silmarils no longer detects NetBSD executables.
- Added external TTW! (IFF cruncher) done by Ronald van Dijk. Thanks
  for that one.
- Added IlScuro and Switch externals done by Codetapper. Thanks for
  the stuff.
- PseudoPacker now directly decrunches files without exe header. No
  need to use ADDHEAD of xfdDecrunchAddr.
- Included ISC external in master library and fixed it a lot. It now
  can handle multipass ISC files and also files with a crunchrate
  higher than 50%. Please remove external ISC.
- Added STORECOMMENT option to xfdDecrunchAddr tool.
- Included PCompress2 external in master library and added data
  scanning. Please remove the external file.
- Fixed and shortened JR decruncher. Thanks Codetapper for example
  files.
- Fixed Enforcer hit for corrupt Titanics files.
- Fixed and shortened VDCO decruncher.
- Again fixed IAM (ATM5) Packer. Now it really works. :-)

XFD 1.26 [xfdmaster.library 39.3]
- ATOM decruncher now removes 2 byte security buffer. Thanks Don Adan
  for the hint.
- Optimized and fixed IAM packer slave. Thanks Don Adan for example
  files.
- Removed VOL1 external, as it is included in new LOB added in release
  1.25. Thanks Don Adan for the hint.
- Splitted StoneCracker 4.04 and 4.04 Library to support really short
  library files.
- Updated all the missing internal clients to V39. All internal data
  clients support user targets now, when it is possible for that type.
- Added HAL! ID to MasterCruncher3.0 Data client. Thanks Don Adan for
  some files.
- Added Pseudo Packer 1.0 address cruncher as Pseudo external.

XFD 1.25 [xfdmaster.library 39.2]
- Fixed CP and ATOM slaves. The decrunch routines should not be able to
  crash anymore. Thanks Mr. Larmer for the example files. These clients
  are the first external V39 clients.
- Fixed little bug in GZip slave.
- Both executable test heads (C and ASM) support V39 auto allocation
  now.
- Imploder Data slave bug fixed.
- Updated some more clients to V39.
- Fixed Enforcer hits in Crunch, 4GetIt!, ImploderClone clients and in
  master library.
- Added new Cruncher ID's MLDC & MD12 (PowerPacker), PAC/01 (RNC) and
  Pack (StoneCracker 4.04). Thanks to Ronald van Dijk for example
  files.
- Added or updated LOB, LZSS, NJMP, XPAC and Silmarils externals.
  Thanks Don Adan for the files.

XFD 1.24 [xfdmaster.library 39.1]
- Added support for TurboSqueezer5.1. Thanks to Richard Wagenführer for
  sending the cruncher. Fixed TurboSqueezer6.1 Segment Decruncher.
  Added xfdSegHead.a to source drawer. This header allows to test the
  segment functions.
- Again fixed PowerPacker4.0 Reloc correction routine. The library will
  no longer crash for some defective files, but produce files which
  contain additional stuff behind the real data. Using a file split
  utility to remove that should produce a valid executable file again.
  This is a bug of PowerPacker and not of xfdmaster.library.
- Fixed broken error detection for PowerPacker files.
- Added segment support to "MegaCruncher Obj".
- Added "Unknown Cruncher 2" (Unknown2 external). Anyone who knows the
  name of that address cruncher? Thanks Don Adan for some example
  files.
- Added SubPacker1.0, a (lossy) ProTracker module packer. Thanks Martin
  Jeppesen for the cruncher.
- Fixed MasterCruncher3.0 Data detection (corrupted since Release
  1.22).
- Added Data scanning to Crunch1.3 slave.
- Included PCR4 decruncher made by Jan Poruba.
- Joined PMC and TurtleSmasher2.0 decrunch code and improved it a bit.
- Fixed bug in StoneCracker data slaves.
- Added auto buffer allocation feature. When USERTARGET is supported
  the master library automatically allocates the buffer for client.
  Added xfdrr_MinSourceLen field to allow easy buffer truncation
  checks. The decrunch routine of data slaves can be really short now,
  when the format allows to supply size information in Recog function.
- Bumped version to 39.
- Updated internal slaves to support new features. As a result some
  more of the data slaves support USERTARGET now.
- Added FileShield linker. Thanks to Heiner Schneegold for example
  files.
  NOTE: The first unlinked file is really useless, as it contains
  only 1 zero word and 3 RTS instructions.

XFD 1.23 [xfdmaster.library 38.7]
- Updated AddressHead to support 2 more headers (total 10 now).
- Fixed bug in PowerPacker4.0 Reloc correction routine, which caused a
  crash for at least 2 (partly) defective files.
- Moved DeluxeCruncher into library, as it is a ByteKiller clone.
  Please remove external DeluxeCruncher.
- Added support for StoneCracker 4.10 Plain Address header and
  ByteKiller 2.03/2.05. Address crunched files no longer pass a hunk
  structure test, as there are lots of files with defective structure
  which are still decrunchable and the decrunch slaves do not need a
  correct structure.
- Fixed bug in FileDescript linker which caused a crash on 68000 CPU's.
- Added ByteKiller97 slave. What guy did a ByteKiller clone in 1997?
  And additionally he forgot to add pad bytes in the hunk version.
- Fixed Crunch external to support BSS hunks.
- ProPack slave now supports files with missing HUNK_END.

XFD 1.22 [xfdmaster.library 38.6]
- Added new Cruncher ID's SLAM (StoneCracker 4.04), ViS1 & ViSL
  (CrunchMania), FLT! (Imploder), KDUB (MasterCruncher 3.0),
  LSD! (MasterCruncher 3.0 or CrunchMania), 1AM & 2AM (StoneCracker).
  Please remove KDUB, LSD! and 1AM externals.
  Thanks to Rafal Mania and Don Adan for example files.
- Added StoneCracker2.92 Data. External 89A8 is obsolete now.
- Added updated decrunchers. Thanks to Martin Jeppesen for sending
  them.
- Added FileDescript Linker (xDiz and TxtExtract). These are the first
  two implemented linkers, which do not use executable files.
- Included Installer script made by Chris Young.
- Replaced ByteKillerFake by newer ByteKillerClone. Thanks Don Adan for
  the file.
- Added "Unknown Cruncher 1" (Unknown1 external). Anyone who knows the
  name of that address cruncher? Thanks Martin Jeppesen and Don Adan
  for example files.
- Fixed bug in xfdList.
- GZip external is a lot saver now, updated DeluxeCruncher and
  AddrHeads.
- Added LeCrunch external. I do not have the cruncher itself. Would be
  fine if anyone could send it.
- Added Crunch external for Crunch1.3 and Crunch1.4ß files. Remove CRUa
  or related externals.
- Moved Supplex into master library as "Mega Cruncher Obj".
- Added "PowerPacker4.0 LoadSeg Overlay" files support.
- Added TUC1.16 decruncher done by Georg Hörmann. As you can see Georg
  is still alive and programming (I did not get TUC finished for about
  a half year now.). TUC is really a worst example of programming.

XFD 1.21 [xfdmaster.library 38.5]
- Bugfix in xfdmaster.library 38.3 "PK Protector 2.00" slave. Special
  thanks to Jan Andersen for sending me the bug report from Alex van
  Niel. Released as xfdmaster.library 38.4.
- From now the library is no longer done by Georg but by Dirk Stöcker.
  Maybe that changes back again in future. Nobody knows :-)
- Included PPbk in xfdmaster.library now doing complete decrunching.
  Please remove PPBK from LIBS:xfd directory!
- Added ID XPKZ to CrunchMania and PACK to PowerPacker.
- Added new externals PCompress2, GZip, DataPACK, ISC, DeluxeCruncher
  and their sources.
- New external AddrHeads removes xfd and ObjectMaster address headers.
- Included xfdDecrunchAddr tool in the distribution.
- Updated LSD! external to support fake CrM2 files.
- Added Text-Linkers EXP1.1, ETA0.91, ETA0.99 and ETA1.00. Has anyone
  a linker program or not recogniced linker files? Please send them.
- Added new V38.5 AmigaE support files done by Sven Steiniger.
- Added Crunch-O-Matic 1.0 (COMatic external). This cruncher seems to
  be buggy, as some of the decrunched files are corrupt. The decruncher
  itself should not do any weird things (like crashing) except
  producing corrupt files, as there is no way testing the files.
  Solutions, bug fixes or newer Crunch-O-Matic versions are welcome.
- Fixed a bug Georg introduced in 38.3 SyncroPacker fix. Normal
  SyncroPacker files are recogniced again.
- Removed some little Enforcer hits in GNU-Packer, FlashSpeed and TSK.
- Updated some other external decrunchers.

XFD 1.20 [xfdmaster.library 38.3]
- Removed externals AMOS, CRND, CRUN, FUCK as they are included in the
  external ByteKillerFake too. Thanks to Dirk Stöcker for the hint.
- PowerPacker Data slave supports PP2O files now (capital O instead of
  zero). Thanks to Dirk Stöcker again.
- Added new externals DMP0, PCompress and Supplex written by Dirk
  Stöcker and Nils Görs. Thanks guys, this really saved me some work.
- Added sourcecodes for new PCompress and Supplex externals.
- Added support for patched DragPack 1.0 files. These will not appear
  very much as they are made by hand, but it was simple to implement,
  so why not? Thanks to Dirk Stöcker again for the example.
- Added support for another SyncroPacker version to the S.P. slave.
  The example file must have been created by a version different to
  4.6, but I don't know if any other versions exist, so I added it
  to 4.6. Thanks again to Dirk for the file.
- Improved ProPack slave. It now supports files with manipulated IDs.
  But the correct algorithm type in the ID is still required, so some
  totally overwritten IDs will still not be recognized.
- Added StoneCracker 4.03 slave. Thanks to Dirk for the files.
- Reworked recognition for StoneCracker 4.04 files. Manipulated IDs
  will be accepted now. Thanks to Dirk for the files.
- Reworked ProPack slave again. It now accepts any kind of
  manipulation. Thanks to Dirk for the files.
- Fixed CP external. This one recognized 'CPic' files and then crashed.
  As I don't have CP files, I just added a 'negative' recognition to
  avoid CPic files. Thanks to Dirk for the bug report.
- Added PK-Protector 2.00 slave. This will just remove the protection
  from crunched files so you can decrunch them afterwards. Thanks to
  Mr.Larmer for sending the program.

XFD 1.19 [xfdmaster.library 38.2]
- Added external slave 'UNIX-Compress' and its sourcecode written by
  Dirk Stöcker. Thanks a lot. This is the first slave written in 'C'
  and a good example how to do it correctly.
- Fixed problem with PowerPacker Data slaves. With odd file lengths the
  slaves crashed on MC68000. Thanks to Dirk Stöcker for the report.
- Added recognition for 'PARA' files to Imploder slave. It's just a
  cloned FImp file and the external PARA slave wrongly recognized
  'SCOPTIONS' files as PARA crunched. Please remove PARA slave from
  LIBS:xfd!! Thanks again to Dirk for the report.
- Added new Include files for 'C' language. These are 100% correct
  and have been created by Dirk Stöcker. Thanks once again.
- Fixed Autodocs: Some synopsises for 'C' were incorrect. Thanks one
  more time to Dirk ;-)
- Fixed Imploder Data slave: The last longword is just a checksum that
  has been stripped at some clones, I don't test for this any longer.
  Thanks for the example files to Dirk.
- Added old Imploder version. I can only guess which version created
  the file sent by Dirk Stöcker (maybe 1.0?), because I've never seen
  such an Imploder file header and I don't have Imploder 1.0, but it's
  definately an original Imploder file. Anyway, such files are handled
  correctly now.
- Added PowerPacker 2.0 slave. Thanks to Dirk for the example file.
- Fixed bug in CrunchMania Data slaves and added XFDPFF_RECOGLEN and
  XFDPFF_USERTARGET support.
- Added XFDPFF_RECOGLEN and XFDPFF_USERTARGET to Imploder Data and
  PowerPacker Data slaves. All important data formats support the
  new flags now, I will add them to the minor slaves somewhere in
  the near future.
- Added xfdm_ExecBase field to the library base. Not all internal
  slaves can support this cached pointer, but most will do in the
  future. The main library code already supports the field for better
  CPU performance.
- Did a little definition add-on I forgot in v38.1: If slaves support
  XFDPFF_RECOGLEN but can't for what reason ever determine the correct
  lengths for return to the caller, they set xfdrr_MinTargetSize and
  xfdrr_FinalTargetSize to -1. So please check for those values in
  your applications. Sorry!
- Added support for cached ExecBase to almost every internal slave
  and by the way fixed some bad library calls that might have caused
  crashes (funny: all errors stuck in error handling code ;-)

XFD 1.18 [xfdmaster.library 38.1]
- Added support for CrunchyDat 1.0 files. Thanks go to Bert Jahn for
  sending me that packer.
- Added new feature to xfdRecogBuffer(): The recog code can determine
  the length of the decrunched file already during recognition. The
  caller then knows how big the buffer for decrunching must be and
  can allocate its own buffer for that purpose. This is supported by
  xfdDecrunchBuffer() now. All this meant changes in xfdBufferInfo,
  lots of additional flags and a new structure called xfdRecogResult.
  See autodocs for further information.
  Idea by Dirk Stöcker, author of XPK, to make XFD more compatible to
  XPK and let XPK benefit from the power of xfdmaster.library.
- Unfortunately, in the current state of development, everything is
  prepared for the new features, but no slave supports them until now.
  And there will always be slaves that never ever support them because
  it's simply impossible to calculate the decrunched length without
  starting to decrunch the files.
  Nevertheless I will try to update all slaves as soon as possible.
- Here we go: Added support for new features to StoneCracker Data
  slaves and ProPack Data slaves to test the new options. Works fine!
  Now it's your turn, Dirk ;-)
- Added external slaves and sourcecodes (4GetIt, BHC3, ImploderClone,
  PPBk) written by Dave Jones. Thanks dude!

XFD 1.17 [xfdmaster.library 37.8]
- Added support for StoneCracker 2.99b files. Thanks to Mr. Larmer for
  sending me that old cruncher.
- Fixed bug in xfdScan() routine that caused crashes when using hooks.
  Thanks again to Mr. Larmer for the report.
- Finally added support for old ProPack data files. These use the same
  identifier like the new ones, therefore it was a bit complicated to
  determine the correct type. Thanks again to Mr. Larmer for example
  files and decrunchers.

XFD 1.16 [xfdmaster.library 37.6]
- Fixed problem with ProPack (RNC) executables that contain hunks
  with reloc information. Thanks to Mr. Larmer/Wanted Team for the
  example file.
- Added JEK!, LeCr and Vice decrunchers written by Mr. Larmer.
- Added support for PowerPacker LoadSeg (PPLS) files. Thanks for
  the suggestion to WEPL. These files may cause problems because
  overlayed files are crunched as well with this format without
  any differences :-(

XFD 1.15 [xfdmaster.library 37.5]
- Added support for CFP 1.35/1.36 protected files.
- Fixed bug in xfdStripHunks(). It may happen that a hunk_name etc.
  is the very last hunk without any other information after it. In
  this case the old routine crashed. Thanks for the example file to
  Christoph Dietz.
- Added new ProPack strain. Thanks to WEPL for sending the sample.
- Added 68000-fixed version of BOND external slave to the library.
  Thanks to Dirk Stöcker for the bug report.
- Fixed external CP slave. Now it won't produce wrong recognitions
  any longer. Thanks to Holger Wessling and Emmanuel Poirier for
  the example files.

XFD 1.14 [xfdmaster.library 37.3]
- Added CPU cache handling code to all routines that manipulate any
  buffers. I hope this will reduce problems with 68040/060 CPUs.
- Replaced several buggy sublibraries by Mr.Larmer/Wanted Team with
  new cleaned-up versions. Thanks for that updates, dude.
- Added new sublibrary (DPRa) and some Amiga E stuff by DII. Thanks!

XFD 1.13 [xfdmaster.library 37.2]
- Added segment support to Titanics Cruncher 1.1/1.2, Spike Cruncher,
  ProPack, TurboSqueezer 6.1/8.0 and HQC Cruncher 2.0 slaves.
- Added Master Cruncher 3.0 Data slave, added segment support to
  Master Cruncher 3.0 slave and rewrote parts of the Master Cruncher
  decrunch routines.
- Added new version of xfdPatch with a serious bug fixed. Sorry folks!
- Arhh! Bug fixed in the optimized Crunchmania routines added in 1.12.
  Empty code hunks caused a system crash. Thanks to Holger Wessling
  for the report and the example files.
- Fixed little bug in the StoneCracker 4.04 Data length calculation.
  No crash this time :-) Thanks to Holger again for the example file.
- Added segment support to DragPack 2.52 slave.
- Added XFDPFF_RELMODE flag support to the following slaves: Propack,
  Imploder (Normal/Lib/Overlay) and CrunchMania (Normal/Lib/Simple)!
  As these crunchers already allocate their hunks during LoadSeg(),
  I wrote a hunk manager that checks the memory type of each loaded
  hunk and switches to another area if neccessary.
- Added segment support to Chryseis Cruncher 0.9 and ReloKit 1.0.
  Finally I made it!! All internal reloc slaves support full segment
  decrunching and relocation modes now :-))
- Combined Powerpacker x.x Master/Normal to simple PowerPacker x.x
  slaves. This saves memory and CPU time.
- Added data scan support to LightPack 1.5 and TurtleSmasher 2.00
  Data slaves. Changed CrunchMaster 1.0 type from data to address.
- Added data scan support to ST Cruncher 1.0 Data slave. Now all
  internal data slaves support data scanning!!
- Added Super Cruncher 2.7 slave with buffer and segment support.
- Added Ultimate Packer 1.1 slave with buffer and segment support.
- Added Old ProPack (RNC) slave. Thanks to WEPL for the sourcecode
  and the example files. This slave cannot handle XFDREL_#? as only
  the first hunk is crunched and all others are already relocated at
  decrunch time. Sorry!
- Added SA/SC/SF/SP/SQ Cruncher slave. Here we have a big problem:
  There exist different versions of the SA, SC and SP formats with
  different crunch algorithms. Therefore these will only be scanned
  for, but not decrunched. SF and SQ should work properly. Thanks to
  WEPL for the sourcecode and the example files.
- Added PowerPacker Patch 1.0 slave. This silly tool adds different
  headers to standard PowerPacker 4.0 files. Thanks to Dave Jones
  for sending that stuff.
- Added ExeDescript 1.0 Linker to the internal linker brain. This
  one is a bit special as it just adds a data hunk at the end of a
  file with some text in it. To recognize this stuff, the whole file
  must be in memory. Sorry, but the xfdm_MinLinkerSize field is of
  no use any longer for this type of linker. Thanks to Dave Jones
  for sending lots of example files.

XFD 1.12 [xfdmaster.library 37.1]
- Fixed problem in ProPack slave. It may happen that some hunks are
  not crunched in the RNC format but included as plain hunks. This has
  not been supported correctly. Thanks to Dave Jones and John Aadnoy
  for the example files.
- Optimized decrunch speed of CrunchMania slave by factor 50 !!!
  You won't see it with small files, but Holger Wessling sent me two
  files that took several minutes to decrunch with the old routine
  and about 4 seconds with the new one (the file had up to 140 hunks
  and 6200 reloc entries at 700000 bytes). Thanks Holger.
- Added lots of external decrunchers written by Mr.Larmer/Wanted Team.
  Thanks for all the work you had with that stuff.
- Added new utility called xfdPatch. Just use it!
- Added an extra feature to Imploder and CrunchMania slaves:
  they both will decrunch even some modified files now. Thanks to
  Dave Jones for sending the 'The Party IV' 40k intros.
- Added full GNU Packer 1.2 support. Thanks to Mr.Larmer/Wanted Team
  for sending that stuff.
- Added new version of xfdPatch that allows to set relocation modes.
- Added support for TrashEliminator 1.0.
- Added new version of xfdLibInfo.
- Added new functions to xfdmaster.library: xfdScanData(),
  xfdFreeScanList() and xfdObjectType(). The data scanner is based
  on an idea by Holger Wessling. Thanks dude!
- Added new fields to xfdBufferInfo and xfdSegmentInfo structures.
  Read the autodocs for more details about the new behaviour of
  xfdRecogBuffer()/xfdRecogSegment() concerning external slaves.
  This was neccessary as a lot of people sent me files that made
  some trouble with external slaves. Thanks to Axel Folley, Holger
  Wessling, John Aadnoy and all the others for the example files.
- Added new utility called xfdScan that supports the new data scan
  routines.
- Added data scan support and improved data recognition/testing to
  ANC, SoundTracker Song, CrunchMania, DragPack 2.52, GNU Packer,
  IAM (ICE!/ATM5), PMC, StoneCracker, XPK, ProPack, PackIt and
  Imploder data slaves.
- Added new versions of xfdList, xfdDecrunch and xfdPatch.
- Added data scan support for PowerPacker PP20 data. This code is
  a real data analyzer that checks data for proper decrunchability.
  The crypted data PX20 however can not be scanned in deep mode.
- Added segment support to QuickPowerPacker 1.0.
- Added new function xfdInitScanHook() for easy hook management.
- Added ProPackExe external decruncher. Thanks to WEPL for sending
  this new format.

XFD 1.11 [xfdmaster.library 36.4]
- Added new versions of xfdDecrunch, xfdList and xfdUnlink with
  several bug fixes and/or new features.
- Fixed support for Hunk_Reloc32Short in xfdTestHunkStructureFlags(),
  xfdRelocate() and xfdStripHunks(). Thanks to WEPL for the report.
- Added new/updated external decrunchers written by WEPL (thanks
  for all your work): Ice_TSM, SSUR, TPWM, BOND, CMP1, LOB, DeCloner.
- Added Oberon include file for xfdmaster.library. Thanks again to
  WEPL for that stuff. Please note that it is written for XFD 1.07
  and therefore a bit old, but you may modify it for your needs.
- Added external decruncher for 4Vx written by Psygore. Thanks to
  Holger Wessling for sending it.
- Added full segment decrunch support to Imploder, Imploder Library
  and Imploder Overlay slaves. No dirty jump-in hacks, but a real
  emulation that also corrects the hunktable entries of overlays.
- Fixed PowerPacker 3.0/4.0 Overlay segment decrunching code.
  The entries in the hunktable haven't been updated.

XFD 1.10 [xfdmaster.library 36.3]
- Added recognition and unlink code for Glue 2.2 and Glue 2.3 text
  linkers. You will get the text file and the original executable
  as a result after unlinking such files. Thanks to Markus Schmall
  and Dave Jones for the example files.
- Finally fixed Imploder stuff to work 100% correctly. The new
  method is a bit slower, but doesn't waste any memory any longer.
  The length calculation of the old one was based on a rough guess,
  now it's counted byte by byte. Corrupted data is detected now and
  won't lead to a big crash any longer. The new code also recognizes
  if a hunk was originally data or code.
- Added support for Imploder Overlay files. These have been only
  recognized, but not decrunched. Now the new length calculation
  made it easy to finally implement that stuff. Thanks to Axel
  Folley for all the example files.
- Added new version of xfdDecrunch.

XFD 1.09 [xfdmaster.library 36.1]
- Oops! XPK slave set password length to 0. This caused some
  trouble when decrunching XPK encrypted files. I forgot to
  set MaxSpecialLen to -1 as XPK has unlimited password lengths.
  Thanks to the guy (sorry, forgot your name) who called me.
- Fixed xfdTestHunkStructure[New]() and xfdRelocate().
  Those two calls now only support hunk types that may really
  exist in load files and no longer any weird linker stuff.
  Added full support for hunk_reloc32short ($3f7/$3fc).
- Added xfdTestHunkStructureFlags() with XFDTHB_NOOVERLAYS
  to force an error if a file is overlayed.
- Added xfdStripHunks() as an easy possibility to remove
  hunk_name, hunk_symbol and/or hunk_debug from files.
- Extended xfdSlave and xfdMasterBase structures.
  Internal slaves have an ID now and can be replaced by
  external slaves. Minimum buffer size to recognize a
  crunched file can be specified for every slave now.
  The largest buffer size is stored in xfdMasterBase and
  can be used as buffer size for recognition purposes.
  Thanks to Dave Jones and the other guy (see above) for
  the inspiration.
- Added new versions of xfdDecrunch and xfdLibInfo.
- Moved external Chryseis slave inside library.
- Added new version of xfdList.
- Fixed defines in xfdmaster.h from $XYZ to 0xXYZ.
- Added external decrunchers: AXIS, LOB and SF written by
  A. Van Helsing/X-TraDe. Thanks to Holger Wessling for
  sending them to me.
- Fixed ProPack slave. Recognizes another executable header
  now and doesn't crash with several hunk_bss any more.
  Thanks to Markus Schmall for reporting the problem.
- Fixed StoneCracker 4.04 slave. Forgot to support empty
  code and data hunks as old compilers produce them.
  Thanks to Dave Jones for the example file.
- Added StoneCracker 4.03 Data slave and replaced SC 4.04
  decrunch code by the optimized version from 'Cozine'.
- Added QuickPowerPacker 1.0 slave.
  Thanks to Dave again for sending this stuff.
- Added xfdAllocObject() and xfdFreeObject() as a replacement
  for Alloc#?Info() and Free#?Info().
- Added xfdRecogLinker() and xfdUnlink() to support so-called
  4EB9-Linkers and their clones.
- Fixed problem with some PowerPacker 4.0 files. It might have
  happened in one special case that one byte of the processed
  reloc hunk was overwritten before it was reprocessed.
  Using a one-byte prefetch mechanism now fixes this bug.
- Added xfdm_MinLinkerSize field in xfdMasterBase structure.
- Added recognition for 4EB9, 4EF9, UFO and XLink linkers to
  the internal linker brain.
- Added unlink code for 4EB9, 4EF9, UFO and XLink linkers.
- Fixed another problem with PowerPacker 4.0 files. If hunks
  are located in chipmem, PP sets the qualifier in the hunk
  header AND in the hunks themselves. OS 2.0+ doesn't like
  this behaviour very much and crashes immediately. The flag
  will therefore be deleted in the hunks now.
  Thanks to Axel Folley for sending me an example file.
- Fixed problem with SoundTracker songs. Some clever game
  coders use the same identifier (PACK) for their files, but
  certainly another algorithm. I use an enhanced recognition
  now that checks the uncrunched length for valid song sizes.
  Thanks again to Axel Folley for all the example files.
- Added the tool xfdUnlink to the package. This is just a
  simple interface for unlinking linked files.
- Added second type of 4EB9 linker and fixed recognition
  for UFO linker.
- Fixed Imploder decrunch code to support modified files too.
  Some guys tried to prevent XFD and also the Imploder itself
  from unpacking files by changing a data to a code hunk.

XFD 1.08 [xfdmaster.library 35.1]
- Added new feature to xfdmaster.library (now version 35):
  Crunchers that require a 16/32 bit key for decrunching are
  supported now. Only neccessary for ProPack (RNC) at the
  moment.
- Added new versions of xfdDecrunch and xfdLibInfo that
  support the new feature.
- Added full support for ProPack, formerly called RNC.
  Now also decrunches executables and key-locked data files.
  Moved the external decruncher inside the library.
- Added support for TetraPack 1.1.
- Added support for HQC Compressor 1.00.
- Added external decrunchers for LZWH and GraftGold.
- Added support for TSK Cruncher, LightPack 1.5 and
  SoundTracker Cruncher 1.0 Exe/Data files.
- Added new tool to the package: HackProPack. This makes it
  possible to decrunch key-locked ProPack data files.
- Re-added Kickstart 1.2/1.3 support to xfdDecrunch.
  Hope everybody is happy now, so am I.
- Added support for segment decrunching to the following
  slaves: DragPack 1.0, StoneCracker 4.00/4.01/4.04,
  CrunchMania Normal/Library/Simple, TNM Cruncher 1.1.
- Revised XPK external decruncher and moved it inside
  xfdmaster.library.
- Moved PMC external decruncher inside the library.
- Debugged arp.library stuff in xfdDecrunch, xfdList
  and HackProPack. Some arp routines behave different from
  dos v37, but it wasn't documented anywhere.
- Added segment support to IAM Packer 1.0 and PackIt 1.0.

XFD 1.07 [xfdmaster.library 34.1]
- Added new sublibs for SSUR, TPWM and TSM crunchers.
  Thanks to WEPL for sending them.
- Added RNC2 support to the RNC external decruncher.
  Thanks to WEPL again for sending me the sourcecode.

XFD 1.06 [xfdmaster.library 34.1]
- Increased library version to 34 because of new features.
  The V34 library is fully downward compatible to V33 libraries.
- Rewritten xfdGetErrorText() function with lots of new error codes.
- Added xfdTestHunkStructureNew() routine that returns detailed
  error codes.
- Added xfdRelocate() routine for better segment list support.
- Extended xfdSegmentInfo structure for relocation mode support.
- Overworked autodocs for more detailed information.
- Overworked whole 'C' support stuff (includes, protos, pragmas).
- Updated Assembler support files.
- Added external decruncher for PMC files.
- Added support for recognition and decrunching of segments
  to the following slaves:
  - PowerPacker 2.3 command files (all modes)
  - PowerPacker 3.0 command files (all modes)
  - PowerPacker 4.0 command files (all modes)
- Added new version of xfdLibInfo with extended information.
- Added external decrunchers for RNC and FIRE files. Thanks to
  Dexter&BartMan/Abyss for sending me this stuff.
- Added ATN! support to xfdmaster.library. Dexter/Abyss sent me
  an external for this one, but it's just a FImp clone, so I
  added it to the internals.

XFD 1.05 [xfdmaster.library 33.6]
- Added decrunch support for StoneCracker 4.04 executables.
- Added external decruncher for XPK files.

XFD 1.04 [xfdmaster.library 33.4]
- Added 'C' includes, protos, pragmas. Thanks to Anders Melchiorsen
  for typing all this stuff. Thanks to Brice Allenbrand too. He also
  typed some 'C' stuff, but Anders was 3 days faster. Sorry!
- Removed arp.library from the package as everybody has it anyway.
- Added decrunch support for StoneCracker 4.04 data & address files.

XFD 1.03 [xfdmaster.library 33.3]
- Added new version of xfdDecrunch with extended features.

XFD 1.02 [xfdmaster.library 33.3]
- Did astonishing speed optimization to CrunchMania decruncher. All
  files with lots of relocs will decrunch about 30 times faster. Thanks
  to Markus Schmall who sent me a file (GadToolsBox with over 8000 [!]
  reloc entries) that took 90 seconds (!) before that code cleanup and
  3 seconds afterwards. Actually he thought XFD would crash, but who
  waits 90 seconds ??? ;-)
- Added Chryseis 0.9 decruncher. This one is implemented as external
  decruncher including sourcecode as an example on how to code that
  kind of thing.
- Added File Imploder (FImp) decruncher.
- Added new version of xfdDecrunch with lots of new features.

XFD 1.01 [xfdmaster.library 33.2]
- Added asm includes, autodocs and fd files.
- Final fixes in password code.
- Added new versions of xfdDecrunch and xfdLibInfo.
- Added support for external decrunchers.

XFD 1.00 [xfdmaster.library 33.1]
- First public release.
