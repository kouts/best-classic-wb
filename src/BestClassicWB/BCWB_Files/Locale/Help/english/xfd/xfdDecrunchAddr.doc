NAME
	xfdDecrunch 1.6

SYNOPSIS
	xfdDecrunchAddr SOURCE/A,DEST=TO,HEADER/N,ADDHEAD/S,DECRADDR,
	JMPADDR,STCO=STORECOMMENT/S

DESCRIPTION
	xfdDecrunchAddr unpacks address crunched executablefiles. It
	requires Kickstart V37+.

	When calling it "xfdDecrunchAddr ?" you get above synopsis.
	Entering "?" here again brings you a deeper help.

	SOURCE specifies the file(s) that should be decrunched.
	Wildcards are not supported.

	DEST is the file to save the result to.
	Without DEST, the old file will be overwritten.

	HEADER specifies the header type, which should be linked to
	the decrunched file:
	0 - No header is linked.
	1 - Only the executable hunk information is linked. This is useful
	    when the executable program is completely relocatable and thus
	    needs not to be forced to a certain memory region.
	2 - Only the executable hunk information is linked, but this
	    contains one additional BSS hunk.
	3 - The xfdDecrunch 1.08 simple header is linked.
	4 - The xfdDecrunch 1.08 professional header is linked.
	11- This is like 1, but the header overwrites file start and end.
	12- This is like 2, but the header overwrites file start and end.
	13- This is like 12, but has an additional empty RELOC hunk.
	
	Header types 1 and 2 are useful, when the decrunched file is again
	crunched with another cruncher. The other headers would hide this
	and xfd cannot recognize the file. Be careful when using this
	header, as created files will crash, when using absolute addresses.

	Header types 11 to 13 are useful, when a file is double time
	address crunched and the inner file-structure is overwritten by
	NOP's or other commands. Be sure you know what you do when using
	these headers!

	xfdDecrunchAddr automatically checks if destination is normal
	executable (should not happen ever - only when someone forgot to
	unhunk the file before crunching) or if it is double crunched
	by testing header type 1 and 2 internally. A message appears in
	case xfdDecrunchAddr got such an file.
	You should save the file with the header type printed there and
	start xfdDecrunchAddr again. When header type 0 is told it maybe
	needed to use types 11 to 13.

	A special XFD external is supplied in LIBS:xfd/, which recognizes
	xfdDecrunch, Object Master and other link headers and removes them.
	You can use it to change the header type of decrunched file.

	ADDHEAD forces xfdDecrunchAddr to do nothing except adding one
	of above headers. For headers 3 and 4 you need to specify DECRADDR
	and JMPADDR. If no JMPADDR is given, xfdDecrunchAddr uses the
	DECRADDR instead for JumpIn as well.
	
	STORECOMMENT stores the jump address and decrunch address of file
	in file comment when uncrunching with xfd.

HISTORY
