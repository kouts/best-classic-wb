NAME
	HackProPack 1.00a

SYNOPSIS
	HackProPack FILE/A,FROM/K,TO/K

DESCRIPTION
	The cruncher ProPack by Rob Northen Computing offers a
	special mode for crunching data files with a 16 bit key.
	This prevents unauthorized persons from unpacking such
	a file if they don't have the right key. Until yesterday!

	HackProPack finds the right keys for locked data files.
	It requires either Kickstart V37+ or the arp.library
	together with older OS releases.

	FILE specifies the file that should be analyzed.
	No wildcards supported.

	Usually the whole possible range of keys (1-65535/$1-$ffff)
	will be tested on the locked file. With FROM and TO, you
	may set a different range. This is useful if you want to
	have a guess first, or if you don't want to wait all the
	time to scan the whole range but do it step by step. Both
	FROM and TO support either decimal or hexadecimal values.

	When the right key has been found, write it down somewhere
	and decrunch the file either with ProPack or xfdDecrunch.

EXAMPLES
	Shell> HackProPack DH0:Data/Locked.RNC
		Tests all possible keys on that file.

	Shell> HackProPack Locked.RNC FROM 4000 TO 5000
		Tests keys 4000 to 5000 on that file.

	Shell> HackProPack Locked.RNC TO $8000
		Tests keys $1 to $8000 on that file.

ABOUT
	HackProPack uses a totally new method to find the right
	key. The file is unpacked only once, together with an
	array of key-related information. The actual key scanning
	is only based on that array and a 16 bit CRC checksum.
	Together with the highly optimized code, this certainly
	is the fastest method ever developped on the Amiga.

	BUT: You need CrunchedLength+(UncrunchedLength*2) bytes
	of free memory.

	The scanning time depends on the size of the data file,
	the key itself (1234 will be reached earlier than 5678)
	and certainly on your CPU speed. For really big files
	(256-512kB), it might take some hours.

HISTORY
