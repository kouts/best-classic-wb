NAME
	xfdScan 1.1

SYNOPSIS
	xfdScan SOURCE/A,DEST/A,NE=NOEXTERN/S,SO=SCANODD/S

DESCRIPTION
	xfdScan searches for crunched data areas inside files.
	It requires either Kickstart V37+ or the arp.library
	together with older OS releases.

	SOURCE specifies the file (with path) that should be
	scanned. No wildcards or directories supported.

	DEST specifies the basic filename that should be used
	to save the crunched data if something was found.
	xfdScan appends '.00' and so on to the basic filename
	as there may be more than one crunched file.

	NOEXTERN switches off the usage of external slaves.
	Use this option only if external slaves crash your
	computer or otherwise behave in an annoying way.

	SCANODD causes the data scanner to scan at odd
	addresses too. This option causes an error if you
	don't have at least a 68020 CPU. Don't use this too
	much as most data is word-aligned anyway.

EXAMPLE
	Shell> xfdScan dh0:BigFile ram:Data

	Scans the file 'dh0:BigFile' and saves the resulting
	files (if any) as 'ram:Data.00' etc.

HISTORY
	xfdScan 1.1
	- Fixed name problem with more than 100 found files.

	xfdScan 1.0
	- First public release. Just a very simple program that
	  does what is necessary.
