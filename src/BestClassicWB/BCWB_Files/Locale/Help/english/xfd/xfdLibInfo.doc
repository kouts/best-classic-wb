NAME
	xfdLibInfo 1.06

SYNOPSIS
	xfdLibInfo

DESCRIPTION
	xfdLibInfo displays the name, ID, required xfdmaster version
	and available functions of all slaves in xfdmaster.library.
	It requires either Kickstart V37+ or the arp.library together
	with older releases of the OS.

	Meaning of the abbrevations:
	ID - internal slave ID
	MV - required master version
	RB - RecogBuffer() function
	DB - DecrunchBuffer() function
	F1 - RecogSegment() or ScanData() function
	F2 - DecrunchSegment() or VerifyData() function

	If you can read "++" in a column, the function is available,
	otherwise you'll see "--".

	The XFDPFF_#? field gives information about the different
	flags set in xfds_PackerFlags.
