NAME
	xfdList 1.04

SYNOPSIS
	xfdList FILE,ALL/S,NE=NOEXTERN/S

DESCRIPTION
	xfdList examines files and prints the names of the
	packers/linkers. It requires either Kickstart V37+
	or the arp.library together with older OS releases.

	FILE specifies the file/drawer that should be examined.
	Wildcards of any kind are supported.
	If FILE is not specified, the current directory will
	be examined.

	xfdList only examines one directory level. With ALL,
	it goes as deep as possible.

	NOEXTERN prohibits the use of external slaves for
	recognition purposes.

EXAMPLES
	Shell> xfdList DH0:C/#?
		Examines the contents of DH0:C.

	Shell> xfdList DF0:#?/#?.(library|device) ALL
		Examines any drawer deeper than level one
		on DF0: for filenames ending with .library
		or .device.

HISTORY
	xfdList 1.04
	- No more Enforcer hits when called without arguments

	xfdList 1.03
	- Added option NOEXTERN.

	xfdList 1.02
	- Fixed xfdFreeObject() call. Some bytes have not been
	  released correctly. Thanks to WEPL for the hint.
	- Fixed problems with empty files. They have been
	  reported with the status of the last file. Thanks
	  again to WEPL for the report.
	- Fixed problem with single '*' wildcard. This was not
	  interpreted as '#?', but as the current Shell window.
	  This actually is a DOS problem, but replacing a '*'
	  internally with '#?' fixes the problems. Thanks to
	  Holger Wessling for the hint.

	xfdList 1.01
	- xfdm_MinBufferSize of xfdmaster.library v36+ is used
	  to determine the size of the recog buffer.
	- Added recognition code for linkers.

	xfdList 1.00a
	- Debugged some arp.library stuff.

	xfdList 1.00
	- First public release.
