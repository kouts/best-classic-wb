NAME
	xfdUnlink 1.01

SYNOPSIS
	xfdUnlink SOURCE/A,DEST1/A,DEST2/A

DESCRIPTION
	xfdUnlink unlinks files that have been linked together with
	so-called 4EB9-Linkers. It requires either Kickstart V37+
	or the arp.library together with older OS releases.

	SOURCE specifies the file (with path) that should be
	unlinked. No wildcards or directories supported.

	DEST1 and DEST2 specify the filenames that should be
	used to save the unlinked files.

EXAMPLE
	Shell> xfdUnlink dh0:Linked ram:Unlinked1 ram:Unlinked2

	Unlinks the file 'dh0:Linked' and saves the resulting
	files as 'ram:Unlinked1' and 'ram:Unlinked2'.

HISTORY

	- Fixed xfdFreeObject() call. Some bytes have not been
	  released correctly. Thanks to WEPL for the hint.

	xfdUnlink 1.00
	- First public release. Just a very simple program that
	  does what is necessary.
