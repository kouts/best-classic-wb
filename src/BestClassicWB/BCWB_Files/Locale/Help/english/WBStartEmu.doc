DESCRIPTION
 Starting with workbench.library v45, tools like wbstart.library
 (by Stefan Becker) are no longer necessary to start a program as if
 it were started from workbench. Because of this I wrote an emu-
 lation of wbstart.library which uses the v45 API to invoke workbench
 programs.
 

KNOWN BUGS
 The original wbstart.library allows you to set the stacksize and
 priority of the program to start. This isn't supported by the
 emulation because of a (current) limitation of workbench.library.
 But it shouldn't be a problem as wb obtains the required information
 from the program icon.
 
 Not a bug but a feature: As a side-effect you can open drawers with
 this emulation, too.
 
 Because of a bug of workbench.library v44, workbench.library v45 is
 required to use this library.
 
 The workbench emulation of DirOpus is INCOMPLETE, so WBStartEmu
 doesn't work with DO.


INSTALLATION
 Copy wbstart.library to your libs: drawer and wbstart-handler to L:


HISTORY
 44.0	first public release
 44.1	Ooops! when copying the struct WBArg, the pointer wasn't 
 	increased thus when passing multiple args the same 
 	argument was passed to the program multiple times.
 	Stupid me, I also forgot to add the TAG_DONE tag to the
 	taglist :(
 44.2	Fixed a very bad bug in the LibExpunge code (referencing
 	to already freed memory). Thanks to Forbid/Permit that this
 	bug never caused any problems ;) Special thanks to Thomas
 	Richter who discovered this bug.
 45.0	because of a bug of wb.library, os3.9/workbench.library
 	is now required to use this library.
 45.1	changed path handling a bit, this hopefully fixes the
 	problem that some programs couldn't be started anymore
 	when this library was used.
 45.1a	added l:wbstart-handler replacement, which uses 
 	wbstart.library.
