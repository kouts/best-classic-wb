     higher to run! 


     1. Introduction 
     --------------- 

        Snap, snap,  snap,  snap, eggs and snap :-)  Ahem...  (If you don't
     get  this  don't  let  it bother you if you think I've gone completely
     bananas :-) 

        PowerSnap is  a  utility  that  allows you to use the mouse to mark
     characters  anywhere on the screen and paste them somewhere else, like
     in  the  CLI  or in a string gadget. PowerSnap will check what font is
     used  in  the  window  you snap from and will look for the position of
     the  characters  automatically.  It  recognizes  all  non proportional
     fonts  of  up to 24 pixels wide and of any height so this should cover
     most  fonts  used.  Snapping and pasting text is done using the mouse,


                                     Page 1


     


     making PowerSnap fast and easy to use.  
        To try  PowerSnap out, double-click its icon, move the mouse over a
     character  on  the  screen,  press  the left Alt key and while keeping
     this  pressed  press  the  left  mouse  button.  After  a  short delay
     (depends  on  how  big  the  font  is) PowerSnap will either flash the
     screen,  indicating  it  hasn't found a character at this position (it
     is  possible  PowerSnap  didn't  look  for  the  correct font), or the
     character  you  are pointing at will be selected. Move the mouse while
     keeping  the  left  Alt  key  and the mouse button down to select more
     characters.  Once  you  are  satisfied  with  what  you  have selected
     release  the  left  Alt key. You can now insert the text you have just
     snapped  by  pressing  either  left  Alt + V or left Alt + right mouse
     button.  
        Both the   left  Alt  and  the  V  keys  mentioned  in  this  short
     explanation   are   user-definable  (see  below).  Also,  don't  start
     snapping  on  a  space because PowerSnap will almost certainly get the
     character  positions  wrong.  You CAN start snapping on a space if you
     have already snapped in the window.  
        New to  PowerSnap  2.1  is the ability to keep a history of snapped
     strings.  You may select from this history to re-paste something.  
        PowerSnap 2.2  adds many new features, among which a font-sensitive
     localized GUI, crawling ants and a possibility to save the settings.  


     2. Installation 
     --------------- 

        To install  PowerSnap  automatically use the installation script or
     install  the  handler  manually by copying 'PowerSnap-handler' to your
     L:  directory.   'PowerSnap-handler'  does not have to be in L: but it
     is  best  if you put it there, PowerSnap will also find it if it is in
     the current directory.  
        If you  want  PowerSnap  to be part of your initial startup (so you
     always  have  the comfort of snapping anything anywhere :-) you should
     put  a simple line saying 'PowerSnap' in your 's:user-startup'. If you
     wish  to  specify  options  include  these  on the same line, like for
     example  'PowerSnap  SMARTSPACE  COLOR  2'.  To  disable the copyright
     message redirect output to NIL: like in 'PowerSnap >NIL:'.  
        The easiest  way  to  install  PowerSnap is to simply drag its icon
     into  the  WbStartup  drawer  of  your  boot  disk/partition.  Specify
     options  in  the  icon's  tooltypes (you will want to set the tooltype
     'CX_POPUP=NO').  


     3. Usage 
     -------- 

     3.1 From CLI or Shell 

        Enter 'PowerSnap  ?' for a CLI usage template, 'PowerSnap ??' for a
     more detailed usage report.  



                                     Page 2


     


        Note: when  PowerSnap  is  run  for  the  first  time  (when  it is
     installed) the settings will be read from its icon.  

        Explanation of the options: 

     CX_PRIORITY n  : Set priority of commodity (default: 0).  

     CX_POPUP YES|NO: Set to NO to not open GUI window when PowerSnap is
                      first installed (default: YES).  

     CX_POPKEY desc : Standard description of hotkey to pop up GUI window
                      (default: control lalt p).  

     NOGUI          : Don't open GUI settings window.  

     QUAL qual      : Set snap qualifier (default: lalt). This is the
                      qualifier that must be down when you press the left
                      mouse button to start snapping. This is also the
                      qualifier for inserting the snapped text. There are
                      two ways to insert snapped text: using the paste key
                      or using the right mouse button.  

     SLQUAL qual    : Set single line paste qualifier (default: lalt
                      lshift). When this qualifier is down and you insert
                      snapped text everything will be put on one single
                      line.  All whitespace (spaces and newlines) between
                      words will be changed to a single space. Very useful
                      for inserting a lot of filenames from a directory
                      for example.  

     MULTIQUAL qual : Set multisnap qualifier (default: lalt lshift). When
                      you start snapping with this qualifier the snapped
                      text will be appended after what you snapped before.
                      A newline will be placed in between the snapped
                      texts, so they are all on their own line. Paste
                      snapped text using the single line qualifier to get
                      everything on one line. Note that the default single
                      line qualifier and the multisnap qualifier are the
                      same. You can still toggle multisnap on or off when
                      you are already snapping. Just change the qualifier,
                      so in the default setup let go or press down the
                      shift key. There is a small delay of 1/8 sec before
                      toggling the snap mode. This was done so it is less
                      likely that you accidently snap in the wrong mode
                      when you release all qualifiers to stop snapping.  

     PASTEKEY c     : Set pastekey (default: V). This key is used to
                      insert the snapped text. Insertion will follow when
                      it is pressed with one of the three possible
                      qualifiers down (QUAL, SLQUAL, PAQUAL).  

     SNAPCHARS      : Start with character snap (default).  


                                     Page 3


     


     SNAPFRAME      : Start with frame snap. PowerSnap has two snap modes:
                      character and frame.  The easiest to explain is
                      frame snap, you just draw a rectangle and everything
                      inside it will be snapped. Character snap will
                      interpret the screen as lines of text (like an
                      editor) and will snap accordingly.  

     [NO]JOIN       : Join mode on/off (default: JOIN). Tells PowerSnap if
                      it's ok to join two lines to a single long line when
                      the first line has a non blank character as its last
                      character. This only works when you are using
                      character, word or line snap.  

     [NO]XEROX      : Xerox insert mode on/off (default: NOXEROX). When
                      xerox mode is on snapped text will be inserted
                      immediately when you stop snapping.  

     COLOR 1-3      : Set color of select box (default: 1).  This sets the
                      color of the complemented characters or ants.  Try
                      all three and see what you like best.  

     MULTICOLOR 1-3 : Set color of multisnap select box or multisnap ants
                      (default: 2).  This sets the color of the
                      complemented characters when doing a multisnap.  It
                      is best to set this to a different color than the
                      normal snap color.  This way you'll have an easy way
                      to see when you are using multisnap.  

     PAQUAL qual    : Set pre-/append qualifier (default: lalt control).
                      When using this qualifier to insert snapped text a
                      string will be prepended to each line and one will
                      be appended.  

     PREPEND str    : Set prepend string (default: "> "). Use this to set
                      the string that will be prepended when you paste
                      with the PAQUAL down. This string can be up to 16
                      characters long. To enter a '"' in the string escape
                      it with a '*'.  E.g. 'PowerSnap PREPEND " *" "'.  

     APPEND str     : Set append string (default: ""). Use this to set the
                      string that will be appended when you paste with the
                      PAQUAL down. Can be up to 16 characters.  

     [NO]SMARTSPACE : If you do a word snap PowerSnap will normally guess
                      at the boundaries of the word by simply looking for
                      empty chars. If you switch SMARTSPACE on however
                      PowerSnap will really try to recognize the
                      characters and stop at spaces as well as unknown
                      characters. This way you will no longer snap part of
                      the 'scenery' when doing a word snap. Only drawback
                      is that it is a bit slower, so it is disabled by
                      default. If you have a faster Amiga (like the A3000)


                                     Page 4


     


                      it is strongly recommended to switch this option on.
                      If you don't exactly understand what I mean try
                      snapping the contents of a qualifier text gadget in
                      PowerSnap's settings window with SMARTSPACE switched
                      on and off.  

     [NO]ALLFONTS   : If you switch ALLFONTS on PowerSnap will try all
                      open fonts in memory when it is looking for
                      characters. This will make the initial snap much
                      slower (depending on how many fonts are open and how
                      fast your Amiga is of course).  Once a specific font
                      is recognized it is remembered and will be tried
                      first next time you snap. So if you snap the same
                      font several times you won't have the delay each
                      time you snap. The default behaviour is to just
                      consider the window's rastport font. Recognition of
                      the window's rastport font is _not_ slower with
                      ALLFONTS on. So with ALLFONTS off you won't
                      recognize a non-rastport font, and with ALLFONTS on
                      you will, but more slowly.  

     HISTORY n      : Set number of lines in history buffer.  PowerSnap
                      will remember the last n snaps.  Pressing Left Alt-H
                      (or whatever you defined to be the history key) will
                      bring up a window with a listview containing these
                      last snaps.  Selecting an entry from the listview
                      will copy the entry to the clipboard so you can
                      paste it again.  The history window is keyboard
                      controllable:  you may use the up and down arrow
                      keys to select an entry.  Press Enter or Return to
                      copy the selected entry to the clipboard, press Esc
                      to cancel.  Default is 0, so no history.  

     HISTORYKEY c   : Set the history key (default:  H).  Pressing this
                      key together with the snap qualifier will pop up the
                      history window.  The history window will appear on
                      the active screen.  A safety has been built into
                      PowerSnap to remove this window if the screen it is
                      on closes.  

     CHARDELAY n    : Set character paste delay in microseconds (default:
                      1).  Some programs have problems if text is pasted
                      to quickly.  Using CHARDELAY you can tell PowerSnap
                      to add a delay between pasting characters.  The
                      delay is specified in microseconds (1 sec = 1000).
                      I doubt you will have to set this higher than 20.  

     LINEDELAY n    : Set line paste delay in microseconds (default:  1).
                      Same as CHARDELAY, but this delay will be added
                      between pasting lines (after pasting a newline).  

     [NO]ANTS       : Switch ants mode on or off (default: NOANTS).  When


                                     Page 5


     


                      ants mode is on PowerSnap will draw a line of
                      crawling ants around the marked text.  

     PATTERN x      : 16 bit hexadecimal crawl pattern for the ants
                      (default: EEEE).  Ignored if PowerSnap is not in
                      ants mode.  

     MULTIPATTERN x : 16 bit hexadecimal crawl pattern for the ants when
                      multisnapping (default: F8F8).  Ignored if PowerSnap
                      is not in ants mode.  

     CLIPUNIT n     : Set clipboard unit (default: 0).  

     RTG            : Force RTG friendly snapping.  


        Following qualifiers are recognized: 

        lshift       Left shift key
        rshift       Right shift key
        ctrl         Control key
        control      Control key
        lalt         Left alt key
        ralt         Right alt key
        lamiga       Left Amiga key
        lcommand     Left Amiga key
        ramiga       Right Amiga key
        rcommand     Right Amiga key
        midbutton    Middle mouse button (if you have one :-)

        Or any   combination   of  these  (separate  the  qualifiers  by  a
     non-alpha  character  like  a  '+', '-' or '|'), e.g. 'lalt+lshift' or
     'lalt-lshift'.  

        You may  run  PowerSnap  again once it has been installed to change
     the settings. 'PowerSnap QUIT' will remove the handler from memory.  

        Examples: 

        o PowerSnap PREPEND "Type " APPEND " OPT N" 

        When  you paste some text 'Type ' will be inserted before each line
        and  '  OPT N' after. If you e.g. snap 'PowerSnap.c' and press left
        Alt  Control  V  the  following will be inserted: 'Type PowerSnap.c
        OPT N' 

        o PowerSnap QUAL "lshift rshift control" 

        This  sets  the  snap qualifier to both Shift keys plus the control
        key.  This  is  a  rather silly example because unless your name is
        Zaphod  Beeblebrox  or  you are very good at doing things with your
        feet  it  is  quite impossible to snap anything with this qualifier


                                     Page 6


     


        :^) 

        o PowerSnap PASTEKEY i 

        Sets  the  paste  key to 'I' instead of 'V'. So pressing left Alt I
        will feed the text in the clipboard to the keyboard.  

     NOTE: - You can toggle between character/frame snap once you have
             started snapping. Just keep the left mouse pressed down while
             you click the right one. Be careful, if you don't keep the
             left button pressed you will insert the text you have
             marked.  
           - PowerSnap has the ability to do word oriented snapping. To
             activate this double-click the left mouse button when you
             start snapping. Note that word snapping forces character
             snapping and frame snapping is no longer possible.  See
             SMARTSPACE on how to improve word snapping.  Tripple-clicking
             the left mouse button will put PowerSnap in line-snap mode,
             this allows you to easily snap whole lines of text.  
           - Press the left mouse button while PowerSnap is inserting to
             abort.  


     3.2 From Workbench 

        PowerSnap recognizes   the   following   tooltypes  (see  CLI/Shell
     options for a more complete explanation): 

     CX_PRIORITY=n  : Priority of commodity (default is 0).  
     CX_POPUP=YES|NO: Set to NO to not open GUI window when PowerSnap is
                      first installed. Set this tooltype to NO if you drag
                      PowerSnap into your WbStartup drawer for a quiet
                      startup (default: YES).  
     CX_POPKEY=desc : Standard description of hotkey to pop up GUI window
                      (default: control lalt p).  
     QUAL=qual      : Snap qualifier (default: lalt).  
     SLQUAL=qual    : Single line qualifier (default: lalt lshift).  
     MULTIQUAL=qual : multisnap qualifier (default: lalt lshift).  
     PASTEKEY=c     : Pastekey (default: V).  
     SNAPFRAME      : Start with frame snap.  
     COLOR=1-3      : Color of select box (default: 1).  
     MULTICOLOR=1-3 : Color of multisnap select box (default: 2).  
     NOJOIN         : Join mode off.  
     XEROX          : Xerox insert mode on.  
     PAQUAL=qual    : Pre-/append qualifier (default: lalt control).  
     PREPEND=str    : Prepend string (default: "> ").  
     APPEND=str     : Append string (default: "").  Do *NOT* put quotes
                      around the pre-/append string.  
     SMARTSPACE     : Switch SMARTSPACE on for improved word snapping.  
     ALLFONTS       : Switch ALLFONTS on to try all open fonts in memory.  
     HISTORY=n      : Set number of lines in history buffer (default: 0).  
     HISTORYKEY=c   : Set history key (default: H).

     CHARDELAY=n    : Set character paste delay in microseconds (default:
                      1).  
     LINEDELAY=n    : Set line paste delay in microseconds (default: 1).  
     ANTS           : Switch ants mode on.

     CLIPUNIT=n     : Set clipboard unit (default: 0).  
     RTG            : Force RTG friendly snapping.  

        Select PowerSnap's  icon  and choose 'Information' from the 'Icons'
     menu.   You  can  now edit PowerSnap's tooltypes, check your Workbench
     manual for more information.  

        The provided  PowerSnap  icon  has  the following tooltypes already
     set:  'SMARTSPACE'  and  'ALLFONTS'.   So edit the icon's tooltypes if
     you  want  to  change  these.   All other tooltypes are also listed in
     brackets.   The  brackets  are  used  to  'comment out' a tooltype, so
     remove them if you want to use the tooltype.  

        Running PowerSnap  twice  will bring up the settings window. Select
     'Quit'  from this window's 'Project' menu to remove PowerSnap. You can
     also   use   the   system's   Commodities  Exchange  program  to  kill
     PowerSnap.  


     4. Settings Window 
     ------------------ 

        When you  start PowerSnap you will be presented with a window where
     you  can  change all of PowerSnap's settings. You may open this window
     at  any  time by using PowerSnap's hotkey (control lalt p, or whatever
     you  set  using  CX_POPKEY)  or  by  using  the  standard  Commodities
     Exchange program.  

        Everything in  this  window  should be fairly self-explanatory.  In
     the  window's  'Project'  menu  you will find 'Hide' and 'Quit' items.
     Selecting  'Hide'  is  the  same  as  using the window's close gadget,
     selecting 'Quit' will remove PowerSnap from the system.  

        Most changes  you  make  will  be effective immediately, so you can
     try  them  out  at  once. The qualifiers will only be changed once you
     close the small window used to set them.  

        Select 'Save  Settings' from the 'Project' menu to save the current
     settings to PowerSnap's icon.  

        Note that  the  code  for  this  window is located in the PowerSnap
     program,  not  in  PowerSnap-handler.  The  window  code  will only be
     loaded  when  actually  needed,  so  PowerSnap  will  use a minimum of
     memory when hidden.

     5. Features 
     ----------- 

       o Fully  supports  the clipboard.device. You can use snapped text in
         all other programs that supports the clipboard.device.  

       o Snaps all printable characters, from ' ' (32) to 'ÿ' (255).  

       o Supports all keymaps.  

       o Uses  a relatively small handler that is about 13K long. PowerSnap
         uses  about  22K  of memory once it is installed (excluding memory
         used by the clipboard.device and commodities.library).  

       o Recognizes  all non-proportional fonts to up to 24 pixels wide and
         of   any   height.   Also  recognizes  scaled  fonts  (bitmap  and
         IntelliFonts).  

       o Recognizes  plain,  underlined,  bold,  inverse,  bold underlined,
         inverse  underlined,  inverse  bold  and  inverse  bold underlined
         characters :-) 

       o Works   with  fonts  with  kerning  data  (like  the  courier.font
         supplied with Workbench 2.0).  

       o Will  remember  character  positions  in up to 8 windows. Once you
         have  snapped  in  a window the initial character position will be
         found immediately and you may also start snapping on spaces.  

       o Joins long lines.  

       o Pre-/appends strings to pasted text.  

       o Has  a  single-line  mode  to paste all snapped text onto a single
         line. Whitespace and newlines will be changed to spaces.  

       o Supports  a  middle mouse button if your mouse has one.  Using the
         middle  button  as  qualifier  gives the possibility to snap/paste
         without touching the keyboard! 

       o Inputhandler   is   written   in   assembly  for  lowest  possible
         overhead.  

       New features for PowerSnap 2.0/2.1: 
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
       o Has  a  full  intuition/gadtools  interface to allow you to change
         all  settings using the mouse. The window code is loaded from disk
         when needed for minimum memory usage.  

       o PowerSnap  is  a  standard commodity. Use the standard Commodities
         Exchange  program  to  enable/disable  it, kill it or to show/hide
         the settings window.  


                                     Page 9


     



       o Multisnap  feature.  Allows  you  to  snap something and add it to
         what  you  snapped  before. This append-snapping is very useful to
         pick  up  several  words that you might want to join into one long
         snap.  The snapped items are put in the clipboard, each on its own
         line  (with  a linefeed between them). You can use the single-line
         paste to paste them all onto one line.  

       o Recognizes  text  in all colors: text in any color on a background
         of any color will be recognized.  

       o SMARTSPACE  feature  to make PowerSnap consider unknown stuff as a
         space.   This  way  you  can  do  _much_  better  word snapping in
         non-shell windows.  

       o Can  be  told  to  try  and  recognize  text  in all open fonts in
         memory.   PowerSnap  will  then  recognize  _all_ non-proportional
         fonts  (up  to  24 pixels wide) also if the font is not set in the
         window's rastport.  

       o Keeps   an  optional  history  of  snapped  text.   PowerSnap  can
         remember  up  to  99  strings  you snap.  Pressing the history key
         will  cause  a  history  window  to  pop  up and will allow you to
         select a string to be re-pasted.  

       New features for PowerSnap 2.2: 
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
       o Has a completely font-sensitive and localized user interface.  

       o Allows you to save the settings from the GUI.  

       o Recognizes text lines with an extra pixel in between.  

       o Allows  you  to  specify  the  clipboard  unit  to use.  Clipboard
         loading  and  saving is now implemented using iffparse.library for
         improved compatibility.  

       o Optional  crawling  ants  to  mark  the  text being snapped!  Ants
         pattern and color are user-definable.  


                                                       As always, enjoy!

                                PROGRAM HISTORY

     ********************************************************************** 
     VERSION 1.0 

     o First release.  

     ********************************************************************** 
     VERSION 1.1 

     o Fixed  bug in reading from clipboard. Strange things could happen if
       the  clipboard  did  not  contain  text.  Unknown clips are properly
       ignored  now.   Incompatibility  with 'ConClip' (Workbench 2.0, V37)
       resolved.   Default COLOR changed to 1.  Version string embedded for
       Workbench 2.0 'Version' command.  
     o To  put  the record straight: PowerSnap is not a modified version of
       Snap  (by  Mikael  Karlsson).  It  is a completely different program
       that  does  most  of the things Snap does. A lot of the features and
       ideas  in  PowerSnap  were influenced by (read: stolen from :-) Snap
       though.  I  just  thought  I'd  mention  this  because  some  German
       magazine  almost  convicted  me  for plagiarism, oh boy :^D  I wrote
       PowerSnap  because  I  was not happy with Snap taking up over 80K of
       my precious memory (PowerSnap only uses about 12K).  
     o The  Amiga  would  hang  if  you tried to snap something just when a
       window  was  about  to  close.  Now all the Intuition functions that
       open/close/modify  windows  are  patched  so  they  will  wait until
       snapping   has   finished.  On  Kickstart  2.0,  the  new  Intuition
       functions are also patched.  This should fix all deadlocks.  
     o Tooltype 'QUIET' added for Workbench startup without window.  
     o Tested with Enforcer and Mungwall debugging tools.  

     ********************************************************************** 
     VERSION 2.0 

       ** ONLY RUNS ON KICKSTART 2.0 OR HIGHER! ** 

     o PowerSnap  is  a  commodity  now,  so it can be disabled/enabled and
       killed  using the Commodities Exchange program. Note the replacement
       of  the  'PRIORITY' argument by 'CX_PRIORITY' to set the commodity's
       priority rather than that of the input handler (default is 0).  
     o Now  has  a  hotkey to pop up a GUI window to set the settings. This
       window  allows you to easily change all of PowerSnap's settings with
       the  mouse.   Note  that  the  QUIET  tooltype has been removed. Use
       CX_POPUP=NO now.  
     o Fixed bug: no longer crashes on fonts with LoChar smaller than 32.  
     o PowerSnap's  character  recognition  has  been  improved. Before you
       could  only  snap  black  or  blue text, now you may also snap white
       text.  In  fact  PowerSnap  now  recognizes  text  in any color on a
       background of any color. How could you ever manage without this :) 
     o New  SMARTSPACE  and NOSMARTSPACE arguments. Allows you to switch on
       much  better,  but slower, word-snap detection. Once you get used to
       this  I  think you won't mind it's a bit slower. It is no problem on


                                    Page 11


     


       faster Amigas of course, like the A3000.  
     o New  multisnap  feature: allows you to add what you snap now to what
       you  snapped before. That way you can e.g. snap several files from a
       directory without having to snap them all at once.  
     o PowerSnap  will  now  optionally  consider every font currently open
       instead  of just the window's rastport font. ALLFONTS and NOALLFONTS
       arguments.  
     o Will  abort  the  snap  if you release the snap qualifier before the
       recognition routine has finished.  
     o Allows you to use lamiga, ramiga and ctrl to specify qualifiers.  

     ********************************************************************** 
     VERSION 2.0a 

     o Error  reporting  improved,  if handler fails to initialize you will
       be informed of the problem (instead of just flashing the display).  
     o Fixed  bug:  if  handler  failed  to  initialize the settings window
       would  appear  and  would  allow you to change settings that weren't
       there :-) 
     o Settings  window  changed to a simple refresh window.  Refreshing is
       a  bit  slower,  but when the window is covered a lot of chip memory
       is saved (especially on screens with a lot of colors/bitplanes).  
     o The  handler  will  now  complain  if it can't find PowerSnap in the
       command path.  

     ********************************************************************** 
     VERSION 2.1 

     o PowerSnap  now  (optionally)  keeps  a  history  list of all snapped
       text.   It is possible to pick a string from this history list to be
       re-snapped.   Pressing  Left  Alt-H  (or another key you may choose)
       will  bring  up  a  window on the currently active screen containing
       the  snap  history.  This window will be automatically closed if the
       screen it is on closes.  
     o Somebody  reported  he  had  a  problem  when using QMouse (with the
       sunmouse  feature)  and  PowerSnap together.  I have changed the way
       PowerSnap  patches  the window functions of Intuition.  If a program
       tries  to  use  an  Intuition  window  function snapping will now be
       aborted.  This should fix all deadlock problems.  
     o Using  the  middle  mouse button qualifier didn't work.  Fixed.  Now
       you can finally snap and paste without using the keyboard.  
     o On  Kickstart  3.0 the wait pointer in the settings window is set to
       the standard Intuition wait pointer.  
     o Two  new  switches:  CHARDELAY  and  LINEDELAY.  Allow you to set an
       optional    delay    when   pasting   characters   and   lines   (in
       milliseconds).   Default  delay is set to 1 microsecond (ok for most
       programs).   MEmacs  (in  your  Workbench's  Tools  drawer  seems to
       require a character delay of 5).  
     o Recognition  of  underscore  character improved.  PowerSnap will try
       to  be  smart about figuring out wether a character is an underscore
       or an underlined space.  
     o PowerSnap  will  check  the  version of PowerSnap-handler. This will


                                    Page 12


     


       take  care  of  the  problem of an old handler still being installed
       and causing weird things to happen.  
     o Amazingly  stupid  bug  fixed  :)   Seems V37 of commodities library
       doesn't  understand  the  'ctrl'  qualifier  (only 'control').  This
       caused  the  default  popup  key  not  to work on Workbench 2.0.  On
       Workbench  2.1  or  3.0 all worked perfectly.  Default popup key has
       been changed to 'control lalt p'.  

     ********************************************************************** 
     VERSION 2.1a 

     o New  feature: line snapping.  Tripple clicking the mouse button will
       put  PowerSnap  in  line  snap mode.  This allows you to easily snap
       whole  lines  of  text from a window.  Clicking again will bring you
       back to character/frame snapping.  
     o New  feature:  trailing  spaces  will be automatically stripped from
       each  line  of  snapped  text.  Spaces will not be stripped from the
       last line of text if you are in character snap mode.  
     o Now   refuses   to   quit   when  some  other  program  has  patched
       intuition.library.    Previous   versions   would   blindly  unpatch
       intuition.library   causing  all  sorts  of  strange  and  wonderful
       crashes :-) 
     o PowerSnap  will  now  generate  both  key-down  _and_ key-up events.
       Previously  only  a  key-down  event  was  sent to the input.device,
       confusing some programs.  
     o Bug  fix:  PASTEKEY  and HISTORYKEY arguments didn't work and caused
       enforcer hits.  Fixed.  
     o Bug  fix:  fixed  enforcer hit that occured when settings window was
       popped up (using Commodities Exchange or popup key).  

     ********************************************************************** 
     VERSION 2.1b 

     o Bug  fix:  inputevents  are now properly cleared before filling them
       in  and  sending them to the input.device.  This should fix problems
       with   corrupted   pastes   a   small   percentage   of   users  was
       encountering.  
     o Word  snapping  improved.   You  may  now  start  word snapping on a
       space.   The space will be included in the snap.  Request from Roger
       Nordin  (or  'a  major  problem' as he calls it).  I hope this makes
       Roger happy :^) 
     o Fixed  the  annoying  'DisplayBeep()  not  going  away  until I stop
       snapping'  problem  :-)  Thanks to Roger Nordin for bugging me about
       this.   This  bug(?)  has  been  in  PowerSnap  from  the day it was
       released but I never bothered to fix it.  
     o History  window  made  keyboard controllable.  Use the up/down arrow
       keys  to  select  an entry.  Press Return or Enter to accept, Esc to
       cancel.   Will  look  best  on  Kickstart  3.0  because the listview
       gadget  uses  a highlight box to show which item is selected, on 2.0
       a text gadget is used.  




                                    Page 13


     


     o Changed  some code to use Kickstart 3.0 bitmap/rastport functions if
       possible.  This should improve future compatibility.  

     ********************************************************************** 
     VERSION 2.2 

     o PowerSnap  has  been  fully  localized  and has been made completely
       font-sensitive.  
     o New  'Save  Settings'  menu  item.   Allows  you to save the current
       settings  to  PowerSnap's  icon.   These  setting  will be read when
       PowerSnap  is installed, even when PowerSnap is started from the CLI
       or Shell.  
     o Made  PowerSnap  more  RTG friendly.  Snapping should now work under
       the  Workbench  emulation  of  the  Piccolo and EGS Spectrum graphic
       cards (not tested).  
     o Some  programs  use  an  extra  pixel  of spacing between their text
       lines.   PowerSnap will try to sniff this out and will try to adjust
       itself  to  this.   Note  that  this  can never be perfect :(  Start
       snapping  on  a  character that has another character directly below
       it to help PowerSnap recognize such cases.  
     o When  asked  to  quit  PowerSnap will now check the return code from
       SetFunction()  when  removing  its  Intuition  patches,  rather than
       directly  peeking  into  the  library's  jump  table.   Should  work
       perfectly with SetMan now.  
     o Improved  speed  of  text  pasting  by  switching  PowerSnap's  task
       priority back to 0 when inserting.  Strange, but it works :-) 
     o Bug  fix:  PowerSnap  could  go into an infinite loop when some high
       ASCII chars were pasted (for example ª - 0xAA).  
     o New command line switch and tooltype: CLIPUNIT.  
     o Due  to very popular demand I added crawling ants to PowerSnap.  New
       command line switches: ANTS, NOANTS, PATTERN and MULTIPATTERN.  
     o PowerSnap  now  uses  iffparse.library  for the clipboard I/O.  This
       should  improve  compatibility  with  other  software  that uses the
       clipboard.  
     o Keyboard   shortcuts  in  history  window  improved.   Now  supports
       Control-Up/Down and Shift-Up/Down.  
     o Bug  fix: PowerSnap would not recognize the last character of a font
       (typically 'ÿ').  
     o Removed  all  (but  one)  Intuition  patches  and  implemented a new
       anti-deadlock  mechanism.   Snapping will be aborted when a deadlock
       occurs  (for  example  a  program  opening  a  window  while you are
       snapping).  

     ********************************************************************** 
     VERSION 2.2a 

     o Fixed  problem  with  RTG detection code and added an RTG switch and
       tooltype  to  force  RTG mode on.  If PowerSnap doesn't work on your
       graphics card try using the RTG switch.  
     o The  clipboard  is now opened when PowerSnap is installed and closed
       when  it  is  removed  and  no longer on every clipboard read/write.
       This avoids the overuse of CLIPS:.  


                                    Page 14


     


     o The  handler  will no longer look for PowerSnap in the command path.
       It will now simply execute PowerSnap from 'PROGDIR:'.  
     o Bug  fix: there was a small amount of memory loss when PowerSnap was
       quit.  Oops :) 
     o Bug  fix:  error  reporting routine (from Workbench) would hang when
       ReqTools was not installed.  
     o Bug  fix:  on systems without locale.library the hex pattern gadgets
       contained a capital X instead of the correct hex number.  
     o Fixed  harmless  mungwall  hit  that  occured  when  'All Fonts' was
       switched  on and PowerSnap couldn't find a character under the mouse
       pointer (allocation of 0 bytes).  
     o Swedish catalog included, translation by Roger Nordin.  
     o French catalog included, translation by Benoit Mortier.
