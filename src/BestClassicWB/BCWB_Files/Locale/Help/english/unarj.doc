        UNARJ version 2.41 release


     This documents new or updated information since UNARJ 2.10.


     ** IMPORTANT NEWS ****************************************************

     The ARJ archive format at 2.39 and above supports an archive
     date-time modified field.

     A new data check has been added to make_table() in DECODE.C to
     account for badly corrupted data.

     There is a newly defined flag bit in the ARJ flags.  See TECHNOTE.DOC
     for details.  UNARJ only supports this flag bit with the "l" command.

     There is an extended header bug in older versions of ARJ, AV.C and
     UNARJ.C.  The extended header processing in read_header() should skip
     4 bytes for the extended header CRC and not 2 bytes.  This is NOT a
     current problem as no versions of ARJ use the extended header.

     The following source line in DECODE.C is AMBIGUOUS and has been
     corrected.

	weight[i++] = 1 << (16 - i);

     **********************************************************************

     Here is the C source code for a simple UNARJ extractor program.  It
     has been portabilized courtesy of Mark Adler for platforms that do not
     support ANSI C.  This UNARJ is NOT meant for use as a production
     quality ARJ extractor.  It is meant for the use of 3rd party
     developers who want to build file readers, etc, for ARJ.  The UNARJ
     source code has been built and tested under Turbo C++ 1.0, Quick C
     2.5, and Coherent 3.2.0.

     It has none of the program protection and other fancy features of
     ARJ 2.41.  It is also VERY SLOW compared to ARJ!!!  In ARJ, all of
     the critical routines are written in assembly language.


     COMMAND SYNTAX:

     UNARJ has been modified to support the four commands: "e", "l", "t",
     and "x".  These are similar to the ARJ version of these commands.
     However, UNARJ does not create directories when using the "x" command.

     Usage:  UNARJ archive[.arj]    (list archive)
	     UNARJ e archive	    (extract archive)
	     UNARJ l archive	    (list archive)
	     UNARJ t archive	    (test archive)
	     UNARJ x archive	    (extract with pathnames)

     UNARJ does not accept any other commands or options.  You cannot
     specify a base directory or select individual files to extract.  UNARJ
     does not support empty directories or volume labels.  UNARJ is much
     slower than ARJ because ARJ is highly optimized using assembly
     language.


     "e" extract command

     This command extracts the contents of the ARJ archive to the current
     directory.  Files in the archive that already exist in the current
     directory will not be extracted.


     "l" list command

     This command lists the contents of the archive to the screen.  The
     UNARJ l command replaces the old AV.EXE program.

     The last field on the display BTPMGVX stands for:
	 B -> file has been marked as a backup
	 T -> text/binary/directory/volume label type
	 P -> path information available in "V" listing
	 M -> compression method used
	 G -> file has been garbled (encrypted)
	 V -> archive has been continued to another volume
	 X -> this file is an extended portion of a larger file


     "t" test command

     This command tests the contents of the archive by extracting the files
     to the NUL device (no data will be written to disk).  If the contents
     of a file is corrupted, UNARJ will display "CRC error!".  If the
     contents are valid, UNARJ will display "CRC OK".

     You can use this command to see if an archive contains pathnames.


     "x" extract with pathnames command

     This command extracts the contents of the ARJ archive to the pathnames
     stored in the archive.  If only filespecs are stored in the archive,
     then the files will be extracted to the current directory.  UNARJ will
     not create missing directories in the pathnames.  You must create them
     manually.	Use the UNARJ t command to see the full pathnames stored in
     the archive.


     PROGRESS INDICATOR

     UNARJ uses a small spinning bar to indicate extraction/testing
     progress.  For some systems that have buffered output, the progress
     indicator may not work.


     BUILDING THE UNARJ PROGRAM

     Source files:  UNARJ.C, DECODE.C, ENVIRON.C, UNARJ.H, UNARJ.DEF,
		    TCCUNARJ.MAK, QCLUNARJ.MAK, OS2UNARJ.MAK.

     For Turbo C/C++, type MAKE /ftccunarj.mak

     For QuickC,      type NMAKE /F qclunarj.mak

     For OS/2,	      type NMAKE /F os2unarj.mak

     For Coherent,    type
	 cc -DUNIX -DCOHERENT -o unarj unarj.c decode.c environ.c

     For UNIX	      type cc -DUNIX -o unarj unarj.c decode.c environ.c

     If you use a compiler other than listed above, the resulting UNARJ.EXE
     will not support restoring file date-time stamps.	You can modify the
     ENVIRON.C file to add these functions for your particular
     implementation environment.

     If you send me your implementations, I will try to incorporate them
     into the next version of UNARJ.


     ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

     I wish to thank Haruhiko Okumura for providing the ideas for ARJ and
     UNARJ.  His AR001 and AR002 provided the basic compression algorithms
     for ARJ 1.0.  At ARJ 2.0, ARJ uses only the secondary Huffman
     compressor from AR002.

     I wish to thank Mark Adler for helping make UNARJ more portable.

     I also wish to acknowledge the use of the file date-time stamping
     routines in Rahul Dhesi's ZOO archiver.

     And to those who have contributed bug reports and porting information,
     I extend my thanks.


     UNARJ LICENSE POLICY FOR ALL USERS:

     The UNARJ program, source code, and the associated documentation
     are copyright (c) 1990-93 Robert K Jung, all rights reserved.

     If you distribute this software to others, you are required to
     distribute the ENTIRE package consisting of the following files:

     README.DOC
     UNARJ.EXE
     UNARJ.DOC
     UNARJ.C
     DECODE.C
     ENVIRON.C
     UNARJ.H
     UNARJ.DEF
     TCCUNARJ.MAK
     QCLUNARJ.MAK

     TECHNOTE.DOC

     I strongly prefer that the files be distributed in the format
     originally released:  UNARJ241.EXE with the ARJ-SECURITY envelope as
     created by the author.  If you must distribute the UNARJ archive in
     another archive format, please archive the UNARJ241.EXE as one file
     inside the other archive.	Re-archival of the software as separate
     files means losing the ARJ security envelope.

     You may freely use the UNARJ C source code provided the end product is
     NOT an ARJ archiver (both compress and extract ARJ files).  If you
     wish to distribute a modified version of UNARJ.EXE, you MUST indicate
     that it is a modified version both in the program and source code.

     I am holding the copyright on the source code, so please do not delete
     my name from the program files or the documentation.

     The UNARJ.EXE program is built from this source using Turbo C++ 1.0.

     You may freely use, copy, and distribute UNARJ.EXE, provided that no
     fee is charged for such use, copying or distribution.

     You may use UNARJ.EXE in a commercial software package provided that
     no additional fee is charged for using UNARJ.EXE and provided that
     the user fully understands that NO warranty or support is provided
     for UNARJ.EXE by ARJ Software.  Moreover, the user must fully
     understand that UNARJ does not have the long usage history that ARJ
     does.

     This source code is intended to promote the building of utilities to
     support the use of ARJ and ARJ archives.


     TECHNICAL SUPPORT:

     Please report any bugs.  I will TRY to fix them.  If you have
     portability improvements, I would appreciate receiving a copy of them.
